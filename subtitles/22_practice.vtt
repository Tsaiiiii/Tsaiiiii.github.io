00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.850
Washington, D.C. has four seasons: winter, spring, summer and autumn or fall.

2
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.920
 My favorite season is summer because of summer vacation!

3
00:00:13.047 --> 00:00:19.673
Hey, that will be a great subject for my new work assignment -- the children’s show.

4
00:00:19.673 --> 00:00:24.801
 I can teach what families in the U.S. do during summer vacation.

5
00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:28.114
 Today, I’m planning the show with Amelia.

6
00:00:28.114 --> 00:00:31.900
 This is the first time we are working together.

7
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.582
 I hope we can work well together.

8
00:00:34.582 --> 00:00:35.529
 Hi, Amelia!

9
00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:36.625
Hi, Anna!

10
00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:41.125
 So, what are we going to talk about on the first show?

11
00:00:41.425 --> 00:00:44.205
I want to talk about summer vacation.

12
00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:45.662
That will be fun!

13
00:00:45.662 --> 00:00:48.225
 Are you going on vacation this summer?

14
00:00:48.385 --> 00:00:50.885
No. This summer I am too busy.

15
00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:52.473
That’s too bad.

16
00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:53.377
It’s okay.

17
00:00:53.377 --> 00:00:55.987
 I can go on vacation next summer.

18
00:00:55.987 --> 00:00:58.751
 This show will be a lot of fun too!

19
00:00:58.943 --> 00:01:01.703
So, Anna, what’s the plan for the show?

20
00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.549
First, we’re going to introduce the subject.

21
00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.635
 Then we can show pictures and video.

22
00:01:09.015 --> 00:01:10.887
We can show tons of video!

23
00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:15.435
Right! We can interview children and have guests, too.

24
00:01:15.855 --> 00:01:18.035
Kids can ask us questions.

25
00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:19.227
Great idea!

26
00:01:19.227 --> 00:01:24.905
 Finally, we can read the questions and tell them where to learn more.

27
00:01:25.205 --> 00:01:26.885
Okay, let’s try it!

28
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:28.044
Let’s do it!

29
00:01:28.044 --> 00:01:30.382
 Hi there! And welcome to …

30
00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:34.105
 Amelia, we don’t have a name for the show.

31
00:01:34.485 --> 00:01:36.378
We’ll think of a name later.

32
00:01:36.378 --> 00:01:38.745
 For now, we'll call it “The Show.”

33
00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:42.008
Hi there! And welcome to “The Show.”

34
00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:46.254
 Today we are going to take you on a summer vacation!

35
00:01:46.254 --> 00:01:50.018
 You will see popular things to do on vacation!

36
00:01:50.018 --> 00:01:51.300
 One is camping.

37
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.785
 When you go camping, you cook, sleep and play outdoors!

38
00:01:56.125 --> 00:02:00.285
When I go camping, Anna, I like to go hiking and fishing.

39
00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:01.079
Me, too.

40
00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.881
 Those are fun things to do when you go camping!

41
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:06.861
 These people are hiking.

42
00:02:07.053 --> 00:02:10.141
Okay, let’s talk about the next vacation.

43
00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:15.224
Another popular summer vacation is going to an amusement park.

44
00:02:15.224 --> 00:02:20.273
 At an amusement park, you go on rides and eat lots of fun food!

45
00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:24.121
I love cotton candy and rollercoasters!

46
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:27.793
 This show is going to be a lot of fun.

47
00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:28.829
I know!

48
00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:33.125
 This is riding a rollercoaster!

49
00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:36.329
What is the last vacation?

50
00:02:36.497 --> 00:02:41.885
One of the most popular vacations is going to the beach!

51
00:02:42.265 --> 00:02:44.005
I love the beach!

52
00:02:44.305 --> 00:02:52.041
When I see that blue ocean, I want to leave Washington, D.C. immediately and go to the beach!

53
00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:53.621
 Maybe next summer.

54
00:02:53.813 --> 00:02:56.901
But right now, it’s time to work!

55
00:02:57.093 --> 00:02:59.085
Right. Until next time.
