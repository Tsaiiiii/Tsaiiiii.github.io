Hello! Washington, D.C. sits on the Potomac River.

2
00:00:04.822 --> 00:00:09.080
 This river is important to the history and culture of the city.

3
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.050
 Today, I am at an outdoor seafood market near the Potomac River.

4
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:21.130
 Some say it is the oldest outdoor seafood market in the United States!

5
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.850
 I am here to buy seafood.

6
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.002
 Let’s see what they have!

7
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.466
 Excuse me. Can you help me?

<c.yellow>I work here.</c.yellow>

22
00:00:35.328 --> 00:00:39.866
<c.yellow> You know, it’s not easy to be a writer.</c.yellow>

23
00:00:39.978 --> 00:00:42.811
Yeah, I heard that. Sorry.

<c.yellow>But this job is great.</c.yellow>

28
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.150
<c.yellow> I work outside by the river.</c.yellow>

29
00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.450
<c.yellow> And I can eat all the free seafood I want!</c.yellow>

30
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.222
That is great, Pete.

31
00:00:54.222 --> 00:00:59.058
 In fact, I am here to buy some seafood for my dinner party.

<c.yellow> They have the freshest seafood in town.</c.yellow>

37
00:01:02.606 --> 00:01:05.554
<c.yellow> How much money can you spend?</c.yellow>

38
00:01:05.682 --> 00:01:08.710
I can only spend $50.

<c.yellow>The crabs here are delicious!</c.yellow>

59
00:01:35.578 --> 00:01:42.767
<c.yellow> They are the best because they come from the nearby Chesapeake Bay!</c.yellow>

60
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:44.132
<c.yellow> Walk this way.</c.yellow>

61
00:01:43.132 --> 00:01:46.680

<c.yellow>You should get the larger crabs.</c.yellow>

67
00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:54.172
<c.yellow> They have the most meat.</c.yellow>

68
