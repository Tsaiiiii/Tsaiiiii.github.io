00:00:00.325 --> 00:00:02.787
Hello from Washington, DC!

2
00:00:02.787 --> 00:00:06.953
 This city has many monuments and memorials.

3
00:00:06.953 --> 00:00:17.368
 Today I am visiting the ones built in memory of our Presidents: Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt.

4
00:00:17.368 --> 00:00:20.493
 I want to learn more about them.

5
00:00:20.493 --> 00:00:22.008
 Hey! Watch out!

6
00:00:20.644 --> 00:00:21.144

00:00:21.144 --> 00:00:21.644

00:00:21.644 --> 00:00:22.144
<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

9
00:00:21.143 --> 00:00:24.312
<c.yellow>Sorry! I didn't see you.</c.yellow>

10
00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:25.939
You were not looking.

11
00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.862
 You should be more careful.

12
00:00:26.506 --> 00:00:27.006
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

13
00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:27.506

<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

15
00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:30.524
<c.yellow>I know I should be more careful.</c.yellow>

16
00:00:29.524 --> 00:00:32.806
<c.yellow> But this game is really fun.</c.yellow>

17
00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.614
What kind of game?

18
00:00:33.282 --> 00:00:33.782
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

19
00:00:33.782 --> 00:00:34.282
<c.yellow>●●</c.yellow>

20
00:00:34.282 --> 00:00:34.782
<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

21
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:38.370
<c.yellow>You have to find things that aren't really there.</c.yellow>

22
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.890
How can you find things that aren’t really there?

23
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.190
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

24
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.690
<c.yellow>●●</c.yellow>

25
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.190
<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

26
00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:44.278
<c.yellow>They're in your phone. See?</c.yellow>

27
00:00:44.414 --> 00:00:48.470
I see. It’s like a scavenger hunt.

28
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.630
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

29
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.130
<c.yellow>●●</c.yellow>

30
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.630
<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

31
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.430
<c.yellow>That’s right!</c.yellow>

32
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.715
I don’t have time for games.

33
00:00:51.715 --> 00:00:54.730
 I want to learn about U.S. presidents.

34
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.150
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

35
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.650

<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

37
00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.760
<c.yellow>Then you should play this game!</c.yellow>

38
00:00:56.759 --> 00:01:05.170
<c.yellow> When you find an American symbol, you win points and a Fun Fact about a U.S. President.</c.yellow>

39
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.650
I have time for this game!

40
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.110
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.610

<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

43
00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:11.778
<c.yellow>Here are the symbols that I caught:</c.yellow>

44
00:01:10.778 --> 00:01:22.050
<c.yellow> the Statue of Liberty for 20 points, Uncle Sam for 40 points and the American flag for 60 points.</c.yellow>

45
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.500
What symbol are you looking for now?

46
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.620
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

47
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.120

<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

49
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.524
<c.yellow>I am looking for the bald eagle.</c.yellow>

50
00:01:26.524 --> 00:01:29.338
<c.yellow> That is 100 points!</c.yellow>

51
00:01:28.337 --> 00:01:33.240
<c.yellow> It should be near the Washington Monument.</c.yellow>

52
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.640
This game is awesome.

53
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.420

56
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.402
<c.yellow>You ought to buy the app right now.</c.yellow>

57
00:01:39.402 --> 00:01:43.044
<c.yellow> It’s called “Catch Americana.”</c.yellow>

58
00:01:43.172 --> 00:01:45.981
Got it. Catch Americana.

59
00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:48.204
 Thanks! Good luck!

60
00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:47.372

63
00:01:47.371 --> 00:01:49.800
<c.yellow>Good luck to you too!</c.yellow>

64
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.267
This is the Jefferson Memorial.

65
00:01:53.267 --> 00:01:59.070
 I know that Thomas Jefferson signed the Declaration of Independence!

66
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.341
 Now, where is that symbol?

67
00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:03.528
 Here it is! My first one.

68
00:02:03.528 --> 00:02:06.892
 It’s an American flag! I won 60 points!

69
00:02:06.892 --> 00:02:11.097
 An American flag works well for Thomas Jefferson.

70
00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:15.303
 I see lots of American flags on Independence Day!

71
00:02:15.303 --> 00:02:17.994
 Where is my Jefferson Fun Fact?

72
00:02:18.162 --> 00:02:22.746
In his lifetime, Thomas Jefferson wrote about 19,000 letters!

73
00:02:22.858 --> 00:02:25.485
I did not know that.

74
00:02:25.485 --> 00:02:28.900
 Where is the next symbol?
