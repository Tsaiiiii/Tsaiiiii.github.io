<c.yellow>Hi, there, sports fans!</c.yellow>

<c.yellow> Baseball is America’s sport.</c.yellow>

3
00:00:03.407 --> 00:00:07.372
<c.yellow> Today, I am going to Nationals Park.</c.yellow>

4
00:00:06.371 --> 00:00:13.302
<c.yellow> It is home to Washington, D.C.’s baseball team- the Washington Nationals!</c.yellow>

<c.yellow>I am taking a bus to a Nationals baseball game!</c.yellow>

12
00:00:20.928 --> 00:00:22.590
Don’t take the bus.

13
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.128
 A taxi is faster than a bus.

Is this one of your memories?

25
00:00:37.775 --> 00:00:38.718

<c.yellow> I can see it now... I am at home plate.</c.yellow>

31
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.280
<c.yellow> I wait for the pitch.</c.yellow>

32
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.640
<c.yellow> The ball comes. I swing.</c.yellow>

33
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.950
<c.yellow> It’s a hit!</c.yellow>

34
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:55.102
<c.yellow> I run to first base, second base, third base, then home plate.</c.yellow>

<c.yellow>No, not yet.</c.yellow>

<c.yellow> Taxi!</c.yellow>

80
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.420
Anna, Anna, that is not a good idea.

81
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.768
 A bicycle is faster than a taxi.

<c.yellow>Oh, Ashley. Ashley, Ashley, Ashley.</c.yellow>

86

<c.yellow> A car is faster than your bicycle.</c.yellow>

87
00:01:38.016 --> 00:01:42.733
In D.C. traffic sometimes a bicycle is faster than a car.

88

94

What do you mean, learn how to ride a bike?

100
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.660
 Oh, Anna!

101
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.185
 You know, Anna, the Metro is faster than a taxi and a bicycle.

102
00:02:07.185 --> 00:02:09.541
 You ought to take the Metro.

103
