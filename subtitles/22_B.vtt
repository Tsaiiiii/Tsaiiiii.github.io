00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.371
Washington, D.C. has four seasons: winter, spring, summer and autumn or fall.

2
00:00:07.371 --> 00:00:12.088
 My favorite season is summer because of summer vacation!

3
00:00:12.088 --> 00:00:19.121
 Hey, that will be a great subject for my new work assignment -- the children’s show.

4
00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:24.500
 I can teach what families in the U.S. do during summer vacation.

5
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.975
 Today, I’m planning the show with Amelia.

6
00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:31.947
 This is the first time we are working together.

7
00:00:31.947 --> 00:00:34.760
 I hope we can work well together.

8
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.753
 Hi, Amelia!

<c.yellow>Hi, Anna!</c.yellow>

13
00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:41.125
<c.yellow> So, what are we going to talk about on the first show?</c.yellow>

14
00:00:41.425 --> 00:00:44.205
I want to talk about summer vacation.

15
00:00:43.045 --> 00:00:43.545

<c.yellow>That will be fun!</c.yellow>

19
00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:48.225
<c.yellow> Are you going on vacation this summer?</c.yellow>

20
00:00:48.385 --> 00:00:50.885
No. This summer I am too busy.

21
00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:50.185

24
00:00:50.185 --> 00:00:52.473
<c.yellow>That’s too bad.</c.yellow>

25
00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:53.377
It’s okay.

26
00:00:53.377 --> 00:00:55.987
 I can go on vacation next summer.

27
00:00:55.987 --> 00:00:58.751
 This show will be a lot of fun too!

28
00:00:57.443 --> 00:00:57.943

31
00:00:57.942 --> 00:01:01.703
<c.yellow>So, Anna, what’s the plan for the show?</c.yellow>

32
00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.549
First, we’re going to introduce the subject.

33
00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.635
 Then we can show pictures and video.

34
00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:08.015
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

35
00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:08.515

37
00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:10.887
<c.yellow>We can show tons of video!</c.yellow>

38
00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:15.435
Right! We can interview children and have guests, too.

39
00:01:14.355 --> 00:01:14.855
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

42
00:01:14.855 --> 00:01:18.035
<c.yellow>Kids can ask us questions.</c.yellow>

43
00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:19.227
Great idea!

44
00:01:19.227 --> 00:01:24.905
 Finally, we can read the questions and tell them where to learn more.

45
00:01:23.705 --> 00:01:24.205
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

46

<c.yellow>Okay, let’s try it!</c.yellow>

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:28.044
Let’s do it!

50
00:01:28.044 --> 00:01:30.382
 Hi there! And welcome to …

51
00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:34.105
 Amelia, we don’t have a name for the show.

52
00:01:32.985 --> 00:01:33.485

<c.yellow>We’ll think of a name later.</c.yellow>

56
00:01:35.378 --> 00:01:38.745
<c.yellow> For now, we'll call it “The Show.”</c.yellow>

57
00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:42.008
Hi there! And welcome to “The Show.”

58
00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:46.254
 Today we are going to take you on a summer vacation!

59
00:01:46.254 --> 00:01:50.018
 You will see popular things to do on vacation!

60
00:01:50.018 --> 00:01:51.300
 One is camping.

61
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.785
 When you go camping, you cook, sleep and play outdoors!

62
00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:55.125
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

63
00:01:55.125 --> 00:01:55.625

<c.yellow>When I go camping, Anna, I like to go hiking and fishing.</c.yellow>

66
00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:01.079
Me, too.

67
00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.881
 Those are fun things to do when you go camping!

68
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:06.861
 These people are hiking.

<c.yellow>Okay, let’s talk about the next vacation.</c.yellow>

73
00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:15.224
Another popular summer vacation is going to an amusement park.

74
00:02:15.224 --> 00:02:20.273
 At an amusement park, you go on rides and eat lots of fun food!

<c.yellow>I love cotton candy and rollercoasters!</c.yellow>

79
00:02:23.121 --> 00:02:27.793
<c.yellow> This show is going to be a lot of fun.</c.yellow>

80
00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:28.829
I know!

81
00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:33.125
 This is riding a rollercoaster!

<c.yellow>What is the last vacation?</c.yellow>

86
00:02:36.497 --> 00:02:41.885
One of the most popular vacations is going to the beach!

87
00:02:40.765 --> 00:02:41.265

<c.yellow>I love the beach!</c.yellow>

91
00:02:44.305 --> 00:02:52.041
When I see that blue ocean, I want to leave Washington, D.C. immediately and go to the beach!

92
00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:53.621
 Maybe next summer.

93
00:02:52.313 --> 00:02:52.813

<c.yellow>But right now, it’s time to work!</c.yellow>

97
00:02:57.093 --> 00:02:59.085
Right. Until next time.
