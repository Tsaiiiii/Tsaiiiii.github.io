Hi, there! Washington, D.C. is a great place to work.

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.297
 Many people here work in government and politics.

3
00:00:09.297 --> 00:00:11.806
 But there are many other jobs.

4
00:00:11.806 --> 00:00:15.206
 You can work at a hospital; a university.

5
00:00:15.206 --> 00:00:17.715
 You can work in a coffee shop.

6
00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:21.519
 Wait a minute, I think I see a friend of mine.

7
00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:23.057
 Pete? Is that you?

<c.yellow>Hi, Anna.</c.yellow>

12
00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:26.761
You look different.

13
00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:29.733
 Your beard … is really big.

<c.yellow>You don’t like it, do you?</c.yellow>

18
00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:35.092
No, no. You just look … different.

19
00:00:35.092 --> 00:00:36.077
 Thank you.

20
00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:38.945
 So, what’s wrong? You look sad.

<c.yellow>I don’t have a job.</c.yellow>

00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:44.185
Sorry, I can’t hear you.

Everyone has a skill.

36
00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:56.751
 You need to find yours.

<c.yellow>I don’t know, Anna.</c.yellow>

41
00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.045
Pete, I am good at asking questions.

42
00:01:01.045 --> 00:01:02.775
 Let me ask you some.

<c.yellow>Really, Anna?</c.yellow>

47
00:01:02.988 --> 00:01:05.367
<c.yellow> Can you help me?</c.yellow>

48
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:06.362
Yes, I can.

49
00:01:06.362 --> 00:01:07.463
 Let me help.

<c.yellow> Maybe you can help.</c.yellow>

55
00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:12.719
Can you write code?

<c.yellow> How is this going to help?</c.yellow>

61
00:01:18.955 --> 00:01:20.339
No, not “cold.”

62
00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:25.139
 Code; you know, for making phone apps, or websites.

63
00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:28.923
 You can make tons of money writing code.

<c.yellow> But I can’t code.</c.yellow>

69
00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:33.477
Next question.

70
00:01:33.477 --> 00:01:34.851

<c.yellow>Do you mean drive a race car?</c.yellow>

75
00:01:35.606 --> 00:01:38.929
<c.yellow> It’s really hard to be a race car driver.</c.yellow>

76
00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.643
<c.yellow> First, you need a race car ...</c.yellow>

77
00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:44.447
No, I mean drive a taxi or drive a bus.

<c.yellow>No, I always fall asleep when I drive.</c.yellow>

82
00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:49.584
Oh, that’s not good.

83
00:01:49.584 --> 00:01:52.514
 Next question. Can you teach?

84
00:01:52.514 --> 00:01:55.835
 You can be a teacher in a school.

<c.yellow>No, I cannot teach.</c.yellow>

89

Can you cook?

90
00:01:59.668 --> 00:02:02.287
 You can be a chef in a restaurant.

<c.yellow> Anna, I can’t do anything. This is sad.</c.yellow>

96

Not everyone can write well.

115
