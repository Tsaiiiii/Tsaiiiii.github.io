<c.yellow>Hello!</c.yellow>

2
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.317
<c.yellow> In Washington, D.C., there are many places that bring history to life.</c.yellow>

3
00:00:05.317 --> 00:00:10.942
<c.yellow> But people who live here often do not have time to see them.</c.yellow>

4
00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:13.898
<c.yellow> They are too busy with work-- like me.</c.yellow>

5
00:00:12.897 --> 00:00:14.808
<c.yellow> Hi, Marsha!</c.yellow>

6
00:00:14.904 --> 00:00:17.032
Hi, Anna! Have a seat.

10
00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:20.087
<c.yellow>Thanks. This was a good idea.</c.yellow>

11
00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:22.696
<c.yellow> Working outdoors is nice.</c.yellow>

12
00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:25.060
Um-hum, it is.

<c.yellow>I am tired.</c.yellow>

17
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.314
<c.yellow> Today was a busy day at work.</c.yellow>

18
00:00:28.314 --> 00:00:32.110
<c.yellow> And I still have work to do!</c.yellow>

19
00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:34.338
Hmm, that’s too bad.

<c.yellow>How are you these days?</c.yellow>

24
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.891
I'm really busy too, Anna.

25
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:39.266
 Let’s get to work.

<c.yellow>Marsha, look!</c.yellow>

30
00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:43.906
<c.yellow> That bus has a photo of Abraham Lincoln!</c.yellow>

31
00:00:44.018 --> 00:00:47.088
That’s an advertisement for Ford’s Theatre.

32
00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:48.658
 They have a new show.

<c.yellow>They have shows where Abraham Lincoln died?</c.yellow>

37
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.504
Yeah, it’s a working theater and a museum.

<c.yellow>I love Lincoln.</c.yellow>

42
00:00:56.868 --> 00:01:02.984
<c.yellow> You know, Marsha, that advertisement reminds me of something.</c.yellow>

43
00:01:03.152 --> 00:01:05.288
Um-hum. What’s that?

49
00:01:08.528 --> 00:01:12.024
<c.yellow> I was not like other children.</c.yellow>

50
00:01:12.192 --> 00:01:14.536
Um-hum, I can believe that.

<c.yellow>I was a tall, serious child.</c.yellow>

55
00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:22.435
<c.yellow> At the playground the other children played silly games.</c.yellow>

56
00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:24.987
<c.yellow> They played with dart guns.</c.yellow>

57
00:01:23.986 --> 00:01:30.455
<c.yellow> They played on the swings, the slide and the teeter-totter.</c.yellow>

58
00:01:29.454 --> 00:01:32.551
<c.yellow> They also played ball.</c.yellow>

59
00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:33.645
<c.yellow> But not me.</c.yellow>

60
00:01:32.644 --> 00:01:38.475
<c.yellow> I loved to read serious books about U.S. presidents.</c.yellow>

61
00:01:37.474 --> 00:01:44.855
<c.yellow> In fact, I wanted to be… don’t laugh… President of the United States.</c.yellow>

62
00:01:43.855 --> 00:01:48.774
<c.yellow> Stop! I know it’s a silly childhood dream.</c.yellow>

63
00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:50.005
I’m sorry.

64
00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:51.492
 It’s not silly.

65
00:01:51.492 --> 00:01:54.000
 Guess what I wanted to be?

<c.yellow>What?</c.yellow>

70
00:01:54.888 --> 00:01:59.293
When I was a kid, I studied the stars and planets.

71
00:01:59.293 --> 00:02:02.288
 I wanted to fly into outer space!
