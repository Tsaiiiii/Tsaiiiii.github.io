00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:08.442
Hello! I am sure that today, in Washington, D.C., there are a lot of great things to do.

2
00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:12.160
 But I am not doing any of them.

3
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.390
 I am sick.

4
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:19.317
 Right now, I'm going to call my boss and tell her I cannot come in to work.

5
00:00:20.231 --> 00:00:20.663
Hello?

6
00:00:21.014 --> 00:00:22.348
Ms. Weaver, Hi.

7
00:00:22.348 --> 00:00:24.839
 I can’t come to work today.

8
00:00:24.976 --> 00:00:26.920
Why not? What is wrong?

9
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.617
Well, yesterday I felt fine.

10
00:00:29.617 --> 00:00:32.969
 In the morning, I painted for hours.

11
00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.687
 In the afternoon, I cut wood.

12
00:00:35.687 --> 00:00:37.680
 Then, I built a fire.

13
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.651
Anna, what do you mean?

14
00:00:39.651 --> 00:00:42.004
 Why can’t you come to work today?

15
00:00:42.172 --> 00:00:44.378
I do not feel well.

16
00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:46.468
 I think I’m sick.

17
00:00:46.564 --> 00:00:48.653
I’m sorry to hear that.

18
00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:51.106
 I was sick last week, too.

19
00:00:51.106 --> 00:00:52.468
 I had the flu.

20
00:00:52.644 --> 00:00:53.940
What did you do?

21
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.004
I slept a lot and I drank a lot of water.

22
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:00.120
 Do you have a doctor?

23
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.280
Yes, I do.

24
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.555
You should call your doctor.

25
00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:05.248
 And get lots of rest!

26
00:01:05.384 --> 00:01:06.825
Thanks, Ms. Weaver.

27
00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:08.418
 I’ll call right now.

28
00:01:08.418 --> 00:01:10.163
 I'm calling my doctor.

29
00:01:10.104 --> 00:01:12.876
Now, where does this thing go?

30
00:01:12.876 --> 00:01:15.464
 Hello. This is Dr. Bennett.

31
00:01:15.464 --> 00:01:17.312
 How can I help you?

32
00:01:17.416 --> 00:01:18.895
Hello, Dr. Bennett.

33
00:01:18.895 --> 00:01:19.984
 This is Anna.

34
00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:21.196
Oh, Hi, Anna.

35
00:01:21.196 --> 00:01:22.864
 How can I help you?

36
00:01:22.952 --> 00:01:24.672
I think I’m sick.

37
00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:27.341
Let me ask you a couple of questions.

38
00:01:27.341 --> 00:01:29.184
 Do you have a sore throat?

39
00:01:29.312 --> 00:01:32.048
Yes. I have a sore throat

40
00:01:32.224 --> 00:01:33.760
Do you have a cough?

41
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.080
Yes. I have a cough.

42
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.560
When did you start feeling sick?

43
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.893
This morning.

44
00:01:39.893 --> 00:01:42.059
 Yesterday I felt great.

45
00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:45.399
 In the morning I painted, for hours-

46
00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.016
 in the afternoon I cut wood-

47
00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:49.322
Excuse me, Anna.

48
00:01:49.322 --> 00:01:51.760
 But I don’t need to know all that.

49
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.222
 Do you have a fever?

50
00:01:53.024 --> 00:01:57.850
Oh. My thermometer says 125 degrees?! What??

51
00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.610
Yeah, that’s not right.

52
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.382
Oh. Wait.

53
00:02:00.382 --> 00:02:03.642
 The thermometer was in my hot cup of coffee.

54
00:02:03.786 --> 00:02:06.110
Please take it again, Anna.

55
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.450
Okay, the thermometer says 100.5 degrees.

56
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.780
100.5 degrees is not too high.

57
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.006
 I want you to drink lots of water.

58
00:02:17.006 --> 00:02:19.912
 Rest in bed and get lots of sleep.

59
00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:22.716
That is what my boss said to do.

60
00:02:22.716 --> 00:02:26.028
 Um, Dr. Bennett, when can I go to work?

61
00:02:26.164 --> 00:02:28.446
Don’t go to work for a couple of days.

62
00:02:28.736 --> 00:02:33.708
Yes! I mean, I don’t want to make my co-workers sick.

63
00:02:33.884 --> 00:02:34.774
That’s right.

64
00:02:34.774 --> 00:02:37.100
 Call me back in a couple of days.

65
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.260
I will, Dr. Bennett. And thanks.

66
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.280
 Well, you heard the doctor– no work for a couple of days.

67
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.609
 I need water, sleep and um… lots of movies!

68
00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:55.705
 Well, the doctor didn’t say anything about movies.

69
00:02:55.705 --> 00:02:57.603
 But it can’t hurt!

70
00:02:57.603 --> 00:02:59.302
 Until next time!
