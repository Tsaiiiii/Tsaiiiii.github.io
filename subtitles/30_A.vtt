<c.yellow>Hello! Washington, D.C. sits on the Potomac River.</c.yellow>

2
00:00:03.822 --> 00:00:09.080
<c.yellow> This river is important to the history and culture of the city.</c.yellow>

3
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.050
<c.yellow> Today, I am at an outdoor seafood market near the Potomac River.</c.yellow>

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:21.130
<c.yellow> Some say it is the oldest outdoor seafood market in the United States!</c.yellow>

5
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.850
<c.yellow> I am here to buy seafood.</c.yellow>

6
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.002
<c.yellow> Let’s see what they have!</c.yellow>

7
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:29.466
<c.yellow> Excuse me. Can you help me?</c.yellow>

<c.yellow>What are you doing here?</c.yellow>

18
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.328
I work here.

19
00:00:36.328 --> 00:00:39.866
 You know, it’s not easy to be a writer.

<c.yellow>Yeah, I heard that. Sorry.</c.yellow>

00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:45.251
But this job is great.

25
00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:48.150
 I work outside by the river.

26
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.450
 And I can eat all the free seafood I want!

31
00:00:53.222 --> 00:00:59.058
<c.yellow> In fact, I am here to buy some seafood for my dinner party.</c.yellow>

32
00:00:59.194 --> 00:01:01.011
You came to the right place.

33
00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:03.607
 They have the freshest seafood in town.

34
00:01:03.607 --> 00:01:05.554

<c.yellow>I can only spend $50.</c.yellow>

39
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.230

<c.yellow>First, I want to buy some shrimp.</c.yellow>

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.015
Sure thing. Follow me.

45
00:01:18.015 --> 00:01:21.080

<c.yellow>Ok, now I want to buy some crabs.</c.yellow>

55
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.579
The crabs here are delicious!

56
00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:42.767
 They are the best because they come from the nearby Chesapeake Bay!

57
00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:44.132
 Walk this way.

58
00:01:44.132 --> 00:01:46.680

You should get the larger crabs.

64
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.172
 They have the most meat.
