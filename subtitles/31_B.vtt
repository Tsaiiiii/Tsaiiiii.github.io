Hi, there, sports fans!

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.407
 Baseball is America’s sport.

3
00:00:04.407 --> 00:00:07.372
 Today, I am going to Nationals Park.

4
00:00:07.372 --> 00:00:13.302
 It is home to Washington, D.C.’s baseball team- the Washington Nationals!

5
00:00:13.302 --> 00:00:14.424

<c.yellow>Where are you going?</c.yellow>

14
00:00:16.928 --> 00:00:20.776
I am taking a bus to a Nationals baseball game!

<c.yellow>Don’t take the bus.</c.yellow>

19
00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.128
<c.yellow> A taxi is faster than a bus.</c.yellow>

20
00:00:25.264 --> 00:00:27.050
Oh, good idea.

21
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.366
 You know I love baseball.

<c.yellow>That’s great. Have fun.</c.yellow>

26
00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:36.062
In fact, I wanted to be a baseball player.

<c.yellow>Is this one of your memories?</c.yellow>

31
00:00:36.774 --> 00:00:38.718
<c.yellow> I’m really busy.</c.yellow>

32
00:00:38.814 --> 00:00:39.970
This won’t take long.

33
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.430
 I can see it now... I am at home plate.

34
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.280
 I wait for the pitch.

35
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.640
 The ball comes. I swing.

36
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.950
 It’s a hit!

37
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.102
 I run to first base, second base, third base, then home plate.

38
00:00:55.246 --> 00:00:56.676
It's a home run.

39
00:00:56.798 --> 00:00:58.456
The crowd cheers.

40
00:00:58.568 --> 00:00:59.261

<c.yellow> Have fun at the game, Anna.</c.yellow>

46
00:01:02.776 --> 00:01:04.254
Thanks, Jonathan.

47
00:01:04.254 --> 00:01:04.776

7 o’clock.

No, not yet.

<c.yellow>Anna, you should go a lot earlier than 7 o’clock.</c.yellow>

72
00:01:21.096 --> 00:01:23.741
That is why I’m taking a taxi.

73
00:01:23.741 --> 00:01:24.270
 Taxi!

<c.yellow>Anna, Anna, that is not a good idea.</c.yellow>

78
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.768
<c.yellow> A bicycle is faster than a taxi.</c.yellow>

79
00:01:30.864 --> 00:01:34.368
Oh, Ashley. Ashley, Ashley, Ashley.

80
00:01:34.368 --> 00:01:37.872
 A car is faster than your bicycle.

<c.yellow>In D.C. traffic sometimes a bicycle is faster than a car.</c.yellow>

85
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:46.208
<c.yellow> And right now, there is a lot of traffic.</c.yellow>

86
00:01:46.304 --> 00:01:47.126
Good point.

87
00:01:47.126 --> 00:01:49.220

<c.yellow> Oh, Anna!</c.yellow>

98
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:07.185
<c.yellow> You know, Anna, the Metro is faster than a taxi and a bicycle.</c.yellow>

99
00:02:06.185 --> 00:02:09.541
<c.yellow> You ought to take the Metro.</c.yellow>

100
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.760
<c.yellow> It’s that way.</c.yellow>

101

Bye!

107
00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:19.353
 The Metro was a lot faster than a bus, taxi or bike.

108
00:02:19.353 --> 00:02:22.321
 And now I’m at Nationals Park!

109
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:24.618
 Look at all these fans!

110
00:02:24.618 --> 00:02:27.760
 So many people like to watch baseball.

111
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.320
 There’s the ticket window.

112
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.511
 What?

113
00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:34.000
 The tickets are sold out?

114
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.880
Nooooooo!Nooooooo!

115
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.205
But I really want to watch a baseball game.

116
00:02:41.205 --> 00:02:43.960

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.069
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

122
00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.322
 It is good advice.

123
00:02:52.322 --> 00:02:56.945
 Being early is better than being late.

124
00:02:56.945 --> 00:02:58.960
 Until next time…
