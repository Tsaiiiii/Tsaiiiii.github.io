<c.yellow>Hello, from Washington, D.C.!</c.yellow>

2
00:00:01.612 --> 00:00:07.657
<c.yellow> Today at work I am reading the news for the first time.</c.yellow>

3
00:00:06.657 --> 00:00:09.549
<c.yellow> I am really nervous.</c.yellow>

4
00:00:08.548 --> 00:00:13.603
<c.yellow> But my boss, Ms. Weaver, is here to help me.</c.yellow>

5
00:00:14.353 --> 00:00:16.060
Now, Anna, remember.

6
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.412
 When we read the news we are always reading facts.

7
00:00:20.412 --> 00:00:22.801
 We never show our feelings.

<c.yellow>Sure thing, Ms. Weaver.</c.yellow>

12
00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:26.495
Great. Are you ready?

<c.yellow>Yes.</c.yellow>

17
00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.415
Okay, let’s try the first story!

<c.yellow>Hello, and welcome to The News.</c.yellow>

22
00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:44.957
<c.yellow> A new book is very popular with children and families.</c.yellow>

23
00:00:43.957 --> 00:00:50.330
<c.yellow> This is it. It is about a lost duckling.</c.yellow>

24
00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.407
<c.yellow> The duck's mother cannot find him.</c.yellow>

25
00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:54.090
Stop!

26
00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:02.435
 Anna, when you say the words “duck” and “duckling” you look really sad.

27
00:01:01.275 --> 00:01:01.775

<c.yellow>I do?</c.yellow>

31
00:01:03.983 --> 00:01:06.743
Yes. Sad is a feeling.

<c.yellow>Sad is not a fact.</c.yellow>

36
00:01:07.724 --> 00:01:11.231
<c.yellow> Sorry. Let me try again.</c.yellow>

37
00:01:11.423 --> 00:01:13.614
Okay, she’s trying again!

38
00:01:13.614 --> 00:01:14.315

<c.yellow> The duck’s mother can not find him.</c.yellow>

47
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.407
<c.yellow> But a family gives him a home.</c.yellow>

48
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:38.037
Stop!

49
00:01:38.037 --> 00:01:40.955

<c.yellow>This story is very sad.</c.yellow>

54
00:01:45.575 --> 00:01:46.645
I have an idea.

55
00:01:46.645 --> 00:01:48.713
 Let’s read the second story.

56
00:01:48.713 --> 00:01:50.996
 She’s reading the second story.

57
00:01:50.996 --> 00:01:51.709

<c.yellow> That is awesome!</c.yellow>

64

Stop! Stop!

65
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.957

78

<c.yellow> She rarely talks to reporters.</c.yellow>

79
00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.370
<c.yellow> But when she does,</c.yellow>

80
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.113
<c.yellow> she often says, “Nothing can stop me now!”</c.yellow>
