<c.yellow>Hi there!</c.yellow>

3
00:00:00.628 --> 00:00:06.166
<c.yellow> Washington, D.C. has many fun places to eat.</c.yellow>

4
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:09.999
<c.yellow> But, sometimes it's more fun to cook.</c.yellow>

5
00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:15.546
<c.yellow> In fact, tonight Marsha and I are cooking for friends.</c.yellow>

6
00:00:14.545 --> 00:00:17.765
<c.yellow> Well, she is cooking.</c.yellow>

7
00:00:16.765 --> 00:00:20.287
<c.yellow> I am doing the shopping.</c.yellow>

8
00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:21.598
<c.yellow> It’s Marsha.</c.yellow>

9
00:00:20.597 --> 00:00:22.808
<c.yellow> Hi, Marsha.</c.yellow>

00:00:22.984 --> 00:00:25.848

<c.yellow>Yes, I told you: I have the shopping list.</c.yellow>

15
00:00:28.434 --> 00:00:30.830
<c.yellow> Can you hear it?</c.yellow>

16
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.554
Okay, good. I hear the list.

17
00:00:33.554 --> 00:00:38.114

<c.yellow>Yes, Marsha, I will.</c.yellow>

22
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.990
And do not spend too much time shopping.

<c.yellow>No, Marsha, I won’t.</c.yellow>

27
00:00:45.277 --> 00:00:47.737
<c.yellow> See you later.</c.yellow>

28
00:00:46.737 --> 00:00:51.240
<c.yellow> Sometimes, Marsha worries too much.</c.yellow>

29
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.895
<c.yellow> I love shopping!</c.yellow>

30
00:00:51.895 --> 00:00:56.496
<c.yellow> And, I did not spend too much money.</c.yellow>

31
00:00:55.496 --> 00:01:00.292
<c.yellow> Oh, no! But I did spend too much time!</c.yellow>

32
00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:02.920
<c.yellow> I have to return home now!</c.yellow>

33
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.646
Anna, what took you so long?

34
00:01:06.646 --> 00:01:09.116

39
00:01:09.796 --> 00:01:13.320
<c.yellow> I bought everything on the list.</c.yellow>

40
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.570
Let me see.

41
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:25.942
 You bought a bunch of bananas, a box of pancake mix, a bag of coffee…

42
00:01:25.942 --> 00:01:29.646
 Anna, this is all wrong!

<c.yellow>What do you mean wrong?</c.yellow>

47
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:42.318
<c.yellow> I bought a jar of peanut butter and a loaf of bread… no, wait… two loaves of bread.</c.yellow>

48
00:01:42.494 --> 00:01:46.286
Anna, these are the wrong ingredients!

<c.yellow>These ingredients are all on the list!</c.yellow>

53
00:01:48.893 --> 00:01:53.038
<c.yellow> I took this list from the counter.</c.yellow>

54
00:01:53.214 --> 00:01:58.190
Anna, this is the shopping list for breakfast.

55
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:05.006
 I said, take the shopping list on the refrigerator for dinner!

<c.yellow>Marsha, there was no shopping list on the refrigerator for dinner!</c.yellow>

60
00:02:11.294 --> 00:02:14.725
Oh no! It’s on the floor!!

61
00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:18.024
