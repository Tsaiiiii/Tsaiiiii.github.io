00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:09.260
Last time on Let’s Learn English, Marsha and I invited friends to a dinner party but I shopped with the wrong list.

2
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.143
 Guests are coming soon.

3
00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:14.045
 Marsha is worried but I have a plan.

4
00:00:14.045 --> 00:00:15.771
 Let’s see what it is.

5
00:00:15.771 --> 00:00:18.673
 I just need a couple of ingredients.

6
00:00:18.673 --> 00:00:21.340
 Marsha, please hand me the flour.

7
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.920
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

8
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.420
<c.yellow>●●</c.yellow>

9
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.920
<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

10
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.136
<c.yellow>Anna, where is the flour?</c.yellow>

11
00:00:23.135 --> 00:00:26.440
<c.yellow> It's not in the cabinets.</c.yellow>

12
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.180
I put the flour inside the refrigerator.

13
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.790
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

14
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.290
<c.yellow>●●</c.yellow>

15
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.790
<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

16
00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.530
<c.yellow>Why?</c.yellow>

17
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.954
It’s cold and dry in the refrigerator.

18
00:00:33.954 --> 00:00:37.142
 See, it says: “Put in a cold, dry place.”

19
00:00:37.326 --> 00:00:38.330
Okay.

20
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.330
Now, Marsha, please hand me the eggs.

21
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.670
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

22
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.170
<c.yellow>●●</c.yellow>

23
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.670
<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

24
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.290
<c.yellow>Anna, where are the eggs?</c.yellow>

25
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.690
The eggs are inside the cabinet under the sink.

26
00:00:48.396 --> 00:00:48.896
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

27
00:00:48.896 --> 00:00:49.396
<c.yellow>●●</c.yellow>

28
00:00:49.396 --> 00:00:49.896
<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

29
00:00:48.896 --> 00:00:54.450
<c.yellow>Why are the eggs in here?</c.yellow>

30
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.263
On the farm, we always put the eggs there.

31
00:00:58.263 --> 00:01:01.068
 How else can the chickens see them?

32
00:01:01.068 --> 00:01:03.640
 Okay. You clean the living room.

33
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.198
 I will make dinner.

34
00:01:03.874 --> 00:01:04.374
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

35
00:01:04.374 --> 00:01:04.874
<c.yellow>●●</c.yellow>

36
00:01:04.874 --> 00:01:05.374
<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

37
00:01:04.373 --> 00:01:08.686
<c.yellow>What are you going to make with these ingredients?</c.yellow>

38
00:01:08.878 --> 00:01:10.810
I have a plan.

39
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.350
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

40
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.850
<c.yellow>●●</c.yellow>

41
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.350
<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

42
00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:14.152
<c.yellow>Okay, the apartment is clean.</c.yellow>

43
00:01:13.152 --> 00:01:16.084
<c.yellow> The kitchen is not.</c.yellow>

44
00:01:15.084 --> 00:01:18.210
<c.yellow> What are you cooking?</c.yellow>

45
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.450
I made my favorite recipe: peanut-butter-banana pancakes!

46
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.970
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

47
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:24.470
<c.yellow>●●</c.yellow>

48
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.970
<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

49
00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:27.186
<c.yellow>You made breakfast.</c.yellow>

50
00:01:27.378 --> 00:01:31.714
Yes! I call it let’s-eat-breakfast-for-dinner dinner!

51
00:01:30.783 --> 00:01:31.283
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

52
00:01:31.283 --> 00:01:31.783
<c.yellow>●●</c.yellow>

53
00:01:31.783 --> 00:01:32.283
<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

54
00:01:31.283 --> 00:01:33.201
<c.yellow>Anna!</c.yellow>

55
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.343
<c.yellow> Mmm! Hey, this tastes good!</c.yellow>

56
00:01:37.343 --> 00:01:42.750
<c.yellow> Anna, you made it work!</c.yellow>

57
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.703
That’s our guests!

58
00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:44.169
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

59
00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.669
<c.yellow>●●</c.yellow>

60
00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:45.169
<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

61
00:01:44.168 --> 00:01:46.091
<c.yellow>I’ll answer the door.</c.yellow>

62
00:01:46.046 --> 00:01:47.570
I'll finish here.

63
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.871
 Like I said, sometimes Marsha worries too much.

64
00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:57.607
 When something goes wrong with your plan, just change the plan!

65
00:01:57.607 --> 00:01:59.041
 Till next time!
