00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.974
You know, I am from the country and sometimes I miss it.

2
00:00:05.974 --> 00:00:09.352
 But I really like life in the city!

3
00:00:09.352 --> 00:00:10.947
 I love the city.

4
00:00:10.947 --> 00:00:13.762
 Oh, look. Someone lost a bag.

5
00:00:13.762 --> 00:00:15.545
 Maybe it's theirs.

6
00:00:15.545 --> 00:00:18.360
 Excuse me. Is this bag yours?

7
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.104
No. It's not mine.

8
00:00:20.104 --> 00:00:21.688
 It might be hers.

9
00:00:21.864 --> 00:00:22.912
Thank you.

10
00:00:22.912 --> 00:00:26.056
 Excuse me. Is this bag yours?

11
00:00:26.248 --> 00:00:27.729
No. It's not mine.

12
00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:29.128
 It might be his.

13
00:00:29.264 --> 00:00:30.295
Thank you.

14
00:00:30.295 --> 00:00:32.974
 Hello. Is this bag yours?

15
00:00:33.102 --> 00:00:34.692
Yes, that's mine.

16
00:00:34.692 --> 00:00:37.685
 These are all my travel things.

17
00:00:37.685 --> 00:00:39.742
 Thank you, thank you!

18
00:00:39.846 --> 00:00:41.372
Are you okay?

19
00:00:41.372 --> 00:00:43.486
 You seem nervous.

20
00:00:43.678 --> 00:00:46.892
Well, this is my first visit to Washington, D.C.

21
00:00:46.892 --> 00:00:49.437
 I'm from a small town in the country.

22
00:00:49.437 --> 00:00:50.910
 I feel a little lost.

23
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.247
I am from the country too! And I understand.

24
00:00:55.247 --> 00:01:00.040
 When I first came here, I felt lost all the time.

25
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.076
So, do you like living in the country or in the city?

26
00:01:04.228 --> 00:01:06.892
I like to live in the city.

27
00:01:07.076 --> 00:01:07.756
Why?

28
00:01:07.908 --> 00:01:09.669
The city is exciting!

29
00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:12.856
 It has more culture than the country.

30
00:01:12.856 --> 00:01:16.210
 There are many museums and restaurants.

31
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.649
 Every night, there is theater and music.

32
00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.829
 And, there are more jobs.

33
00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:23.674
 That is why I'm here.

34
00:01:23.852 --> 00:01:25.128
Well, I agree.

35
00:01:25.128 --> 00:01:30.963
 There is more culture in the city and there might be more jobs.

36
00:01:30.963 --> 00:01:33.971
 But the country has more nature!

37
00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:36.614
 It's peaceful and beautiful.

38
00:01:36.614 --> 00:01:39.896
 There are more trees and mountains.

39
00:01:39.896 --> 00:01:41.537
 The air is clean.

40
00:01:41.537 --> 00:01:44.363
 You can go hiking and camping.

41
00:01:44.363 --> 00:01:46.824
 The city is not beautiful.

42
00:01:46.824 --> 00:01:48.830
 It's noisy and dirty.

43
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.880
I disagree.

44
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.004
 I think all the different buildings are beautiful.

45
00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:57.724
 And I like to watch all the different people.

46
00:01:57.892 --> 00:02:00.521
That's another thing that is different.

47
00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:02.947
 People in the country are friendly.

48
00:02:02.947 --> 00:02:04.497
 They always say hello.

49
00:02:04.497 --> 00:02:06.182
 Here, no one says hello.

50
00:02:06.182 --> 00:02:08.204
 I think city people are rude.

51
00:02:08.332 --> 00:02:09.335
Well, I agree.

52
00:02:09.335 --> 00:02:11.414
 Country people are friendly.

53
00:02:11.414 --> 00:02:14.281
 But I don't think city people are rude.

54
00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:16.216
 I think they're just busy.

55
00:02:16.348 --> 00:02:17.792
That's a good point.

56
00:02:17.976 --> 00:02:18.759
Look at me.

57
00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:22.032
 I live in the city and I said "hello" to you.

58
00:02:22.216 --> 00:02:24.384
But you are from the country.

59
00:02:24.552 --> 00:02:26.129
I have an idea.

60
00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.860
 Let's say "hello" to people- to many people!

61
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.448
What? Why?

62
00:02:32.584 --> 00:02:37.792
Well, if we say "hello," maybe they will say "hello" to other people.

63
00:02:37.792 --> 00:02:38.320
 Hello!

64
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.905
And they will say "hello" to more people!

65
00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:43.659
 That's a great idea!

66
00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.914
 I'm glad you found my bag.

67
00:02:46.042 --> 00:02:49.526
Come on. Let's go say "hello" to people.

68
00:02:49.526 --> 00:02:52.661
 We don't have to agree with people.

69
00:02:52.661 --> 00:02:56.145
 They have their opinions. We have ours.

70
00:02:56.145 --> 00:03:01.110
 And as we like to say, you can always agree to disagree!

71
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.590
 Until next time!

72
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.200
 Hello!
