00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.640
Hi, there, sports fans!

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.407
 Baseball is America’s sport.

3
00:00:04.407 --> 00:00:07.372
 Today, I am going to Nationals Park.

4
00:00:07.372 --> 00:00:13.302
 It is home to Washington, D.C.’s baseball team- the Washington Nationals!

5
00:00:13.302 --> 00:00:14.424
 Hi, Jonathan!

6
00:00:14.552 --> 00:00:15.528
Hi, Anna!

7
00:00:15.624 --> 00:00:16.776
Where are you going?

8
00:00:16.928 --> 00:00:20.776
I am taking a bus to a Nationals baseball game!

9
00:00:20.928 --> 00:00:22.590
Don’t take the bus.

10
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.128
 A taxi is faster than a bus.

11
00:00:25.264 --> 00:00:27.050
Oh, good idea.

12
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.366
 You know I love baseball.

13
00:00:30.558 --> 00:00:32.302
That’s great. Have fun.

14
00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:36.062
In fact, I wanted to be a baseball player.

15
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.775
Is this one of your memories?

16
00:00:37.775 --> 00:00:38.718
 I’m really busy.

17
00:00:38.814 --> 00:00:39.970
This won’t take long.

18
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.430
 I can see it now... I am at home plate.

19
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.280
 I wait for the pitch.

20
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.640
 The ball comes. I swing.

21
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.950
 It’s a hit!

22
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.102
 I run to first base, second base, third base, then home plate.

23
00:00:55.246 --> 00:00:56.676
It's a home run.

24
00:00:56.798 --> 00:00:58.456
The crowd cheers.

25
00:00:58.568 --> 00:00:59.261
Woo hoo!

26
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.068
You really love baseball.

27
00:01:01.068 --> 00:01:02.712
 Have fun at the game, Anna.

28
00:01:02.776 --> 00:01:04.254
Thanks, Jonathan.

29
00:01:04.254 --> 00:01:04.776
 Taxi!

30
00:01:04.888 --> 00:01:05.896
Hi, Anna. 

31
00:01:06.008 --> 00:01:06.760
Hi Ashley.

32
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.896
Where are you going?

33
00:01:08.048 --> 00:01:11.208
I am going to see a Nationals baseball game!

34
00:01:11.344 --> 00:01:12.920
What time is the game?

35
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.056
7 o’clock.

36
00:01:14.168 --> 00:01:15.416
Do you have a ticket?

37
00:01:15.528 --> 00:01:16.520
No, not yet.

38
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.952
Anna, you should go a lot earlier than 7 o’clock.

39
00:01:21.096 --> 00:01:23.741
That is why I’m taking a taxi.

40
00:01:23.741 --> 00:01:24.270
 Taxi!

41
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.420
Anna, Anna, that is not a good idea.

42
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.768
 A bicycle is faster than a taxi.

43
00:01:30.864 --> 00:01:34.368
Oh, Ashley. Ashley, Ashley, Ashley.

44
00:01:34.368 --> 00:01:37.872
 A car is faster than your bicycle.

45
00:01:38.016 --> 00:01:42.733
In D.C. traffic sometimes a bicycle is faster than a car.

46
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:46.208
 And right now, there is a lot of traffic.

47
00:01:46.304 --> 00:01:47.126
Good point.

48
00:01:47.126 --> 00:01:49.220
 But I don’t have a bicycle.

49
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.176
Okay, Anna, you can use my bicycle.

50
00:01:53.288 --> 00:01:57.640
Thanks! I really want to learn how to ride one.

51
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.520
What do you mean, learn how to ride a bike?

52
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.660
 Oh, Anna!

53
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.185
 You know, Anna, the Metro is faster than a taxi and a bicycle.

54
00:02:07.185 --> 00:02:09.541
 You ought to take the Metro.

55
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:10.760
 It’s that way.

56
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.904
Good idea. See you later.

57
00:02:13.072 --> 00:02:13.832
Bye, Anna!

58
00:02:13.896 --> 00:02:14.279
Bye!

59
00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:19.353
 The Metro was a lot faster than a bus, taxi or bike.

60
00:02:19.353 --> 00:02:22.321
 And now I’m at Nationals Park!

61
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:24.618
 Look at all these fans!

62
00:02:24.618 --> 00:02:27.760
 So many people like to watch baseball.

63
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.320
 There’s the ticket window.

64
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.511
 What?

65
00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:34.000
 The tickets are sold out?

66
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.880
Nooooooo!Nooooooo!

67
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.205
But I really want to watch a baseball game.

68
00:02:41.205 --> 00:02:43.960
 Does anybody have an extra ticket?

69
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.280
Next time, you should buy your ticket online.

70
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.069
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

71
00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.322
 It is good advice.

72
00:02:52.322 --> 00:02:56.945
 Being early is better than being late.

73
00:02:56.945 --> 00:02:58.960
 Until next time…
