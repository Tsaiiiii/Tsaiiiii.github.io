00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.159
Hi there!

2
00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.903
 Summer in Washington, D.C. is hot and sunny.

3
00:00:05.903 --> 00:00:09.382
 I always ride the Metro to work.

4
00:00:09.382 --> 00:00:13.072
 Riding the Metro is cool and fast.

5
00:00:13.072 --> 00:00:15.497
 But today it’s closed.

6
00:00:15.497 --> 00:00:18.580
 So, I am walking to work.

7
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.700
 Ms. Weaver, I am late this morning.

8
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.248
 The Metro is closed.

9
00:00:24.248 --> 00:00:26.989
 So, I am walking to work.

10
00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:28.462
That’s too bad.

11
00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:30.493
 It’s really hot today.

12
00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.021
Yes it is.

13
00:00:32.173 --> 00:00:35.363
When you arrive, please come to my office.

14
00:00:35.363 --> 00:00:38.021
 I have important news to tell you.

15
00:00:38.173 --> 00:00:40.662
Of course. Good-bye.

16
00:00:40.662 --> 00:00:43.773
 My boss has news for me.

17
00:00:43.773 --> 00:00:50.230
 The question is: Is it good news or bad news?

18
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.861
 Hello, Ms. Weaver.

19
00:00:52.013 --> 00:00:56.450
Anna, I have good news and I have bad news.

20
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.723
 Which do you want to hear first?

21
00:00:58.669 --> 00:01:00.222
The good news.

22
00:01:00.222 --> 00:01:02.995
 No … okay, the bad news.

23
00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:07.815
The bad news is you are not good at reading the news.

24
00:01:08.795 --> 00:01:12.095
Oh. I am very sorry to hear that.

25
00:01:12.995 --> 00:01:17.735
So, starting next month you will not read the news.

26
00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:21.027
Next month is July.

27
00:01:21.027 --> 00:01:23.645
 You are firing me in July.

28
00:01:24.025 --> 00:01:26.690
No. I am not firing you in July …

29
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.112
 or in August or in September.

30
00:01:29.112 --> 00:01:30.969
 That is the good news.

31
00:01:31.137 --> 00:01:34.064
Okay. You are not firing me.

32
00:01:34.064 --> 00:01:36.886
 I am not reading the news.

33
00:01:36.886 --> 00:01:39.185
 What will I be doing?

34
00:01:39.345 --> 00:01:43.306
Well, you are good at asking questions.

35
00:01:43.306 --> 00:01:46.861
 You are good at talking to people.

36
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:50.822
 You are good at showing your feelings.

37
00:01:50.822 --> 00:01:54.275
 And you are great at being silly.

38
00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:57.526
Thank you, Ms. Weaver.

39
00:01:57.526 --> 00:01:59.835
 But what does all that mean?

40
00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:03.839
I have a new assignment for you!

41
00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:08.483
 Your skills are perfect for a new show …

42
00:02:08.483 --> 00:02:10.635
 a children’s show.

43
00:02:11.905 --> 00:02:15.186
A children’s show ...

44
00:02:15.186 --> 00:02:18.770
 That is awesome!

45
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.497
 When do I start?

46
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:22.412
You start next month.

47
00:02:22.412 --> 00:02:25.617
 Start thinking of ideas for the show.

48
00:02:25.721 --> 00:02:27.432
I have tons of ideas!

49
00:02:27.432 --> 00:02:32.077
 I can show children what it’s like in outer space or ...

50
00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:32.648
Great …

51
00:02:32.722 --> 00:02:34.730
… in the deep, dark ocean …

52
00:02:34.937 --> 00:02:37.464
Those are great ideas, Anna.

53
00:02:37.464 --> 00:02:41.075
 Please go think of more … at your desk.

54
00:02:40.643 --> 00:02:44.489
Yes. What other things can I show them?

55
00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.500
 Mt. Everest!

56
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.560
 Everyone has different skills.

57
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.870
 You have skills.

58
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.800
 I have skills.

59
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.209
 The important thing is to know what you are good at.

60
00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.885
 Until next time!
