<c.yellow>You know, I am from the country and sometimes I miss it.</c.yellow>

3
00:00:04.974 --> 00:00:09.352
<c.yellow> But I really like life in the city!</c.yellow>

4
00:00:08.352 --> 00:00:10.947
<c.yellow> I love the city.</c.yellow>

5
00:00:09.946 --> 00:00:13.762
<c.yellow> Oh, look. Someone lost a bag.</c.yellow>

6
00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:15.545
<c.yellow> Maybe it's theirs.</c.yellow>

7
00:00:14.544 --> 00:00:18.360
<c.yellow> Excuse me. Is this bag yours?</c.yellow>

8
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.104
No. It's not mine.

9
00:00:20.104 --> 00:00:21.688
 It might be hers.

No. It's not mine.

16
00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:29.128
 It might be his.

<c.yellow> Hello. Is this bag yours?</c.yellow>

22
00:00:33.102 --> 00:00:34.692
Yes, that's mine.

23
00:00:34.692 --> 00:00:37.685
 These are all my travel things.

24
00:00:37.685 --> 00:00:39.742

<c.yellow>Are you okay?</c.yellow>

29
00:00:40.371 --> 00:00:43.486
<c.yellow> You seem nervous.</c.yellow>

30
00:00:43.678 --> 00:00:46.892
Well, this is my first visit to Washington, D.C.

31
00:00:46.892 --> 00:00:49.437
 I'm from a small town in the country.

32
00:00:49.437 --> 00:00:50.910
 I feel a little lost.

<c.yellow>I am from the country too! And I understand.</c.yellow>

37
00:00:54.246 --> 00:01:00.040
<c.yellow> When I first came here, I felt lost all the time.</c.yellow>

38
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.076
So, do you like living in the country or in the city?

42

<c.yellow>I like to live in the city.</c.yellow>

43
00:01:07.076 --> 00:01:07.756
Why?

47
00:01:06.908 --> 00:01:09.669
<c.yellow>The city is exciting!</c.yellow>

48
00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:12.856
<c.yellow> It has more culture than the country.</c.yellow>

49
00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:16.210
<c.yellow> There are many museums and restaurants.</c.yellow>

50
00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:19.649
<c.yellow> Every night, there is theater and music.</c.yellow>

51
00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.829
<c.yellow> And, there are more jobs.</c.yellow>

52
00:01:20.828 --> 00:01:23.674
<c.yellow> That is why I'm here.</c.yellow>

53
00:01:23.852 --> 00:01:25.128
Well, I agree.

54
00:01:25.128 --> 00:01:30.963
 There is more culture in the city and there might be more jobs.

55
00:01:30.963 --> 00:01:33.971
 But the country has more nature!

56
00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:36.614
 It's peaceful and beautiful.

57
00:01:36.614 --> 00:01:39.896
 There are more trees and mountains.

58
00:01:39.896 --> 00:01:41.537
 The air is clean.

59
00:01:41.537 --> 00:01:44.363
 You can go hiking and camping.

60
00:01:44.363 --> 00:01:46.824
 The city is not beautiful.

61
00:01:46.824 --> 00:01:48.830
 It's noisy and dirty.

<c.yellow>I disagree.</c.yellow>

66
00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:54.004
<c.yellow> I think all the different buildings are beautiful.</c.yellow>

67
00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:57.724
<c.yellow> And I like to watch all the different people.</c.yellow>

68
00:01:57.892 --> 00:02:00.521
That's another thing that is different.

69
00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:02.947
 People in the country are friendly.

70
00:02:02.947 --> 00:02:04.497
 They always say hello.

71
00:02:04.497 --> 00:02:06.182
 Here, no one says hello.

72
00:02:06.182 --> 00:02:08.204
 I think city people are rude.

<c.yellow>Well, I agree.</c.yellow>

77
00:02:08.335 --> 00:02:11.414
<c.yellow> Country people are friendly.</c.yellow>

78
00:02:10.413 --> 00:02:14.281
<c.yellow> But I don't think city people are rude.</c.yellow>

79
00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:16.216
<c.yellow> I think they're just busy.</c.yellow>

80
00:02:16.348 --> 00:02:17.792
That's a good point.

<c.yellow>Look at me.</c.yellow>

85
00:02:17.758 --> 00:02:22.032
<c.yellow> I live in the city and I said "hello" to you.</c.yellow>

86
00:02:22.216 --> 00:02:24.384
But you are from the country.

<c.yellow>I have an idea.</c.yellow>

91
00:02:25.128 --> 00:02:30.860
<c.yellow> Let's say "hello" to people- to many people!</c.yellow>

92
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.448

<c.yellow>Well, if we say "hello," maybe they will say "hello" to other people.</c.yellow>

97
00:02:36.792 --> 00:02:38.320
<c.yellow> Hello!</c.yellow>

98
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.905
And they will say "hello" to more people!

99
00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:43.659
 That's a great idea!

100
00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.914

105
00:02:48.526 --> 00:02:52.661
<c.yellow> We don't have to agree with people.</c.yellow>

106
00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:56.145
<c.yellow> They have their opinions. We have ours.</c.yellow>

107
00:02:55.145 --> 00:03:01.110
<c.yellow> And as we like to say, you can always agree to disagree!</c.yellow>

108
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.590
<c.yellow> Until next time!</c.yellow>

109
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.200
