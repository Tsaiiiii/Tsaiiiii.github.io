00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:00.935
Hello!

2
00:00:00.935 --> 00:00:06.317
 In Washington, D.C., there are many places that bring history to life.

3
00:00:06.317 --> 00:00:10.942
 But people who live here often do not have time to see them.

4
00:00:10.942 --> 00:00:13.898
 They are too busy with work-- like me.

5
00:00:13.898 --> 00:00:14.808
 Hi, Marsha!

6
00:00:14.904 --> 00:00:17.032
Hi, Anna! Have a seat.

7
00:00:17.176 --> 00:00:20.087
Thanks. This was a good idea.

8
00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:22.696
 Working outdoors is nice.

9
00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:25.060
Um-hum, it is.

10
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.421
I am tired.

11
00:00:26.421 --> 00:00:29.314
 Today was a busy day at work.

12
00:00:29.314 --> 00:00:32.110
 And I still have work to do!

13
00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:34.338
Hmm, that’s too bad.

14
00:00:34.474 --> 00:00:35.890
How are you these days?

15
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.891
I'm really busy too, Anna.

16
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:39.266
 Let’s get to work.

17
00:00:39.418 --> 00:00:40.498
Marsha, look!

18
00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:43.906
 That bus has a photo of Abraham Lincoln!

19
00:00:44.018 --> 00:00:47.088
That’s an advertisement for Ford’s Theatre.

20
00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:48.658
 They have a new show.

21
00:00:48.794 --> 00:00:52.290
They have shows where Abraham Lincoln died?

22
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.504
Yeah, it’s a working theater and a museum.

23
00:00:56.632 --> 00:00:57.869
I love Lincoln.

24
00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:02.984
 You know, Marsha, that advertisement reminds me of something.

25
00:01:03.152 --> 00:01:05.288
Um-hum. What’s that?

26
00:01:05.424 --> 00:01:07.436
When I was a little girl…

27
00:01:07.436 --> 00:01:09.529
 When I was a little girl…

28
00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:12.024
 I was not like other children.

29
00:01:12.192 --> 00:01:14.536
Um-hum, I can believe that.

30
00:01:14.688 --> 00:01:17.240
I was a tall, serious child.

31
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.435
 At the playground the other children played silly games.

32
00:01:22.435 --> 00:01:24.987
 They played with dart guns.

33
00:01:24.987 --> 00:01:30.455
 They played on the swings, the slide and the teeter-totter.

34
00:01:30.455 --> 00:01:32.551
 They also played ball.

35
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:33.645
 But not me.

36
00:01:33.645 --> 00:01:38.475
 I loved to read serious books about U.S. presidents.

37
00:01:38.475 --> 00:01:44.855
 In fact, I wanted to be… don’t laugh… President of the United States.

38
00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:48.774
 Stop! I know it’s a silly childhood dream.

39
00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:50.005
I’m sorry.

40
00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:51.492
 It’s not silly.

41
00:01:51.492 --> 00:01:54.000
 Guess what I wanted to be?

42
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.736
What?

43
00:01:54.888 --> 00:01:59.293
When I was a kid, I studied the stars and planets.

44
00:01:59.293 --> 00:02:02.288
 I wanted to fly into outer space!

45
00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:05.900
You know, Marsha, childhood dreams are really important.

46
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.680
They are. And it’s good to remember them.

47
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.848
Hey! I have an idea. Let’s go.

48
00:02:12.984 --> 00:02:13.984
Go where?

49
00:02:14.152 --> 00:02:18.448
Let’s go make our childhood dreams come true.

50
00:02:18.624 --> 00:02:21.847
We’re going to the Air & Space Museum! Yes!

51
00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:28.515
No. We’re going to see a show at Ford’s Theatre just like Abraham Lincoln did when he died!

52
00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.246
 It’s not far from here.

53
00:02:30.398 --> 00:02:33.878
Uh huh. That is your childhood dream.

54
00:02:34.054 --> 00:02:34.898
Good point.

55
00:02:34.898 --> 00:02:38.890
 Okay, next week, we'll come here and be astronauts.

56
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.214
Honestly?

57
00:02:40.342 --> 00:02:41.085
Honestly.

58
00:02:41.085 --> 00:02:48.683
 Tonight we are seeing a show at Ford’s Theatre, where a man shot President Abraham Lincoln.

59
00:02:48.683 --> 00:02:53.886
 This is history come to life… and a childhood dream come true!

60
00:02:53.886 --> 00:02:55.290
 Until next time…
