<c.yellow>Washington, D.C. has four seasons: winter, spring, summer and autumn or fall.</c.yellow>

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:12.920

<c.yellow>Hey, that will be a great subject for my new work assignment -- the children’s show.</c.yellow>

9
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.130
<c.yellow> I can teach what families in the U.S. do during summer vacation.</c.yellow>

10

<c.yellow> Today, I’m planning the show with Amelia.</c.yellow>

11

Hi, Anna!

15
00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:41.125
 So, what are we going to talk about on the first show?

That will be fun!

21
00:00:45.662 --> 00:00:48.225
 Are you going on vacation this summer?

<c.yellow>No. This summer I am too busy.</c.yellow>

26
00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:52.473
That’s too bad.

31
00:00:52.377 --> 00:00:55.987
<c.yellow> I can go on vacation next summer.</c.yellow>

32
00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:58.751
<c.yellow> This show will be a lot of fun too!</c.yellow>

33
00:00:58.943 --> 00:01:01.703

37
00:01:00.878 --> 00:01:05.549
<c.yellow>First, we’re going to introduce the subject.</c.yellow>

38
00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.635
<c.yellow> Then we can show pictures and video.</c.yellow>

39
00:01:09.015 --> 00:01:10.887
We can show tons of video!

<c.yellow>Right! We can interview children and have guests, too.</c.yellow>

44
00:01:15.855 --> 00:01:18.035
Kids can ask us questions.

<c.yellow>Great idea!</c.yellow>

49
00:01:18.227 --> 00:01:24.905
<c.yellow> Finally, we can read the questions and tell them where to learn more.</c.yellow>

50
00:01:25.205 --> 00:01:26.885
Okay, let’s try it!

<c.yellow> Hi there! And welcome to …</c.yellow>

56
00:01:29.382 --> 00:01:34.105
<c.yellow> Amelia, we don’t have a name for the show.</c.yellow>

57
00:01:34.485 --> 00:01:36.378
We’ll think of a name later.

58
00:01:36.378 --> 00:01:38.745

<c.yellow> One is camping.</c.yellow>

66
00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.785
<c.yellow> When you go camping, you cook, sleep and play outdoors!</c.yellow>

67
00:01:56.125 --> 00:02:00.285
When I go camping, Anna, I like to go hiking and fishing.

<c.yellow>Another popular summer vacation is going to an amusement park.</c.yellow>

79
00:02:14.223 --> 00:02:20.273
<c.yellow> At an amusement park, you go on rides and eat lots of fun food!</c.yellow>
