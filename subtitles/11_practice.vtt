Hello! DC is a city for walking

2
00:00:03.786 --> 00:00:07.829
 In our neighborhood, I can do all my errands

3
00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:14.748
 Marsha, before we get ice cream, I need to return three books to the library

4
00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:16.725
 Where is the library?

5
00:00:17.065 --> 00:00:20.449
It is on this street on the corner

6
00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:20.449


7
00:00:20.577 --> 00:00:21.161
Awesome!

8
00:00:21.273 --> 00:00:22.165
Let's go!

9
00:00:24.505 --> 00:00:27.605
Marsha, I can return the books here

10
00:00:27.605 --> 00:00:27.605


11
00:00:30.025 --> 00:00:33.566
Anna, what are those in the books?

12
00:00:34.226 --> 00:00:44.165
Marsha, these are letters to my family and friends back home … four letters! Is there a post office near here?

13
00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:45.242
Um, no

14
00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:47.973
 The post office is far from here

15
00:00:47.973 --> 00:00:51.697
 But there is a mailbox across from the store

16
00:00:51.697 --> 00:00:51.697


17
00:00:51.841 --> 00:01:03.015
Awesome! Let’s go! Marsha, now I need to buy stamps

18
00:01:03.015 --> 00:01:03.015


19
00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:04.423
Do you have cash?

20
00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:04.794
No

21
00:01:04.794 --> 00:01:07.431
 Is there a bank near here?

22
00:01:07.623 --> 00:01:09.475
There is a bank behind you

23
00:01:09.475 --> 00:01:09.475


24
00:01:10.095 --> 00:01:12.252
Thanks, Marsha

25
00:01:12.252 --> 00:01:17.492
 You know our neighborhood so well

26
00:01:17.492 --> 00:01:19.957
 Now I have cash

27
00:01:19.957 --> 00:01:22.577
 I can buy stamps

28
00:01:22.577 --> 00:01:22.577


29
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:25.329
That store sells stamps

30
00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:25.329


31
00:01:25.457 --> 00:01:27.041
Wait here

32
00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:29.505
 I have stamps

33
00:01:29.505 --> 00:01:29.505


34
00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:31.325
Wow, you’re fast

35
00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:31.325


36
00:01:32.265 --> 00:01:40.685
Thank you, thank you letters, for sending my words… my love … to my family and friends -

37
00:01:45.585 --> 00:01:47.205
Do you have more cash?

38
00:01:47.545 --> 00:01:48.485
I do!

39
00:01:49.705 --> 00:01:50.885
Ice cream!!

40
00:01:53.785 --> 00:02:03.585
I love my new neighborhood! Everything is near our apartment! Even hair salons, and ice cream! Until next time!
