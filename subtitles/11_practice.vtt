Hello! DC is a city for walking.

2
00:00:03.827 --> 00:00:07.891
 In our neighborhood, I can do all my errands.

3
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:10.806
 Marsha, before we get ice cream,

4
00:00:10.806 --> 00:00:14.781
 I need to return three books to the library.

5
00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.725
 Where is the library?

6
00:00:17.065 --> 00:00:20.449
It is on this street on the corner.

7
00:00:20.577 --> 00:00:21.161
Awesome!

8
00:00:21.273 --> 00:00:22.165
Let's go!

9
00:00:24.505 --> 00:00:27.605
Marsha, I can return the books here.

10
00:00:30.025 --> 00:00:33.566
Anna, what are those in the books?

11
00:00:34.226 --> 00:00:41.093
Marsha, these are letters to my family and friends back home … four letters!

12
00:00:41.093 --> 00:00:44.165
 Is there a post office near here?

13
00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:48.021
Um, no. The post office is far from here.

14
00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:51.697
 But there is a mailbox across from the store.

15
00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:55.709
Awesome! Let’s go!

16
00:00:55.709 --> 00:01:03.015
 Marsha, now I need to buy stamps.

17
00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:04.423
Do you have cash?

18
00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.431
No. Is there a bank near here?

19
00:01:07.623 --> 00:01:09.475
There is a bank behind you.

20
00:01:10.095 --> 00:01:12.298
Thanks, Marsha.

21
00:01:12.298 --> 00:01:17.437
 You know our neighborhood so well.

22
00:01:17.437 --> 00:01:22.577
 Now I have cash. I can buy stamps.

23
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:25.329
That store sells stamps.

24
00:01:25.457 --> 00:01:29.505
Wait here. I have stamps.

25
00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:31.325
Wow, you’re fast.

26
00:01:32.265 --> 00:01:35.040
Thank you, thank you letters,

27
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.685
 for sending my words… my love … to my family and friends -

28
00:01:45.585 --> 00:01:47.205
Do you have more cash?

29
00:01:47.545 --> 00:01:48.485
I do!

30
00:01:49.705 --> 00:01:50.885
Ice cream!!

31
00:01:53.785 --> 00:01:56.169
I love my new neighborhood!

32
00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:59.171
 Everything is near our apartment!

33
00:01:59.171 --> 00:02:02.084
 Even hair salons, and ice cream!

34
00:02:02.084 --> 00:02:03.585
 Until next time!
