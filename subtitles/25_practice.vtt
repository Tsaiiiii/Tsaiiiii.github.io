00:00:00.325 --> 00:00:02.787
Hello from Washington, DC!

2
00:00:02.787 --> 00:00:06.953
 This city has many monuments and memorials.

3
00:00:06.953 --> 00:00:14.820
 Today I am visiting the ones built in memory of our Presidents: Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt.

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.560
 I want to learn more about them.

5
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.008
 Hey! Watch out!

6
00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:24.312
Sorry! I didn't see you.

7
00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:25.939
You were not looking.

8
00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.862
 You should be more careful.

9
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:30.000
I know I should be more careful.

10
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.806
 But this game is really fun.

11
00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.614
What kind of game?

12
00:00:34.782 --> 00:00:38.370
You have to find things that aren't really there.

13
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.890
How can you find things that aren’t really there?

14
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.278
They're in your phone. See?

15
00:00:44.414 --> 00:00:48.470
I see. It’s like a scavenger hunt.

16
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.430
That’s right!

17
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.715
I don’t have time for games.

18
00:00:51.715 --> 00:00:54.730
 I want to learn about U.S. presidents.

19
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.760
Then you should play this game!

20
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:05.170
 When you find an American symbol, you win points and a Fun Fact about a U.S. President.

21
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.650
I have time for this game!

22
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.778
Here are the symbols that I caught:

23
00:01:11.778 --> 00:01:22.050
 the Statue of Liberty for 20 points, Uncle Sam for 40 points and the American flag for 60 points.

24
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.500
What symbol are you looking for now?

25
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.524
I am looking for the bald eagle.

26
00:01:27.524 --> 00:01:29.338
 That is 100 points!

27
00:01:29.338 --> 00:01:33.240
 It should be near the Washington Monument.

28
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.640
This game is awesome.

29
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.402
You ought to buy the app right now.

30
00:01:40.402 --> 00:01:43.044
 It’s called “Catch Americana.”

31
00:01:43.172 --> 00:01:45.981
Got it. Catch Americana.

32
00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:48.204
 Thanks! Good luck!

33
00:01:48.372 --> 00:01:49.800
Good luck to you too!

34
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.267
This is the Jefferson Memorial.

35
00:01:53.267 --> 00:01:57.540
 I know that Thomas Jefferson signed the Declaration of Independence!

36
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.750
 Now, where is that symbol?

37
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.070
 Here it is! My first one.

38
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.892
 It’s an American flag! I won 60 points!

39
00:02:06.892 --> 00:02:11.097
 An American flag works well for Thomas Jefferson.

40
00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:15.303
 I see lots of American flags on Independence Day!

41
00:02:15.303 --> 00:02:17.994
 Where is my Jefferson Fun Fact?

42
00:02:18.162 --> 00:02:22.746
In his lifetime, Thomas Jefferson wrote about 19,000 letters!

43
00:02:22.858 --> 00:02:25.485
I did not know that.

44
00:02:25.485 --> 00:02:28.900
 Where is the next symbol?
