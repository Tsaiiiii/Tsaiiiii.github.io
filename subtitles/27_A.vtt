<c.yellow>Hello! I am sure that today, in Washington, D.C., there are a lot of great things to do.</c.yellow>

2
00:00:07.442 --> 00:00:12.160
<c.yellow> But I am not doing any of them.</c.yellow>

3
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.390
<c.yellow> I am sick.</c.yellow>

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:19.317
<c.yellow> Right now, I'm going to call my boss and tell her I cannot come in to work.</c.yellow>

00:00:20.231 --> 00:00:20.663
Hello?

<c.yellow>Ms. Weaver, Hi.</c.yellow>

10
00:00:21.347 --> 00:00:24.839
<c.yellow> I can’t come to work today.</c.yellow>

11
00:00:24.976 --> 00:00:26.920
Why not? What is wrong?

<c.yellow>Well, yesterday I felt fine.</c.yellow>

16
00:00:28.617 --> 00:00:32.969
<c.yellow> In the morning, I painted for hours.</c.yellow>

17
00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.687
<c.yellow> In the afternoon, I cut wood.</c.yellow>

18
00:00:34.686 --> 00:00:37.680
<c.yellow> Then, I built a fire.</c.yellow>

19
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.651
Anna, what do you mean?

20
00:00:39.651 --> 00:00:42.004
 Why can’t you come to work today?

<c.yellow>I do not feel well.</c.yellow>

25
00:00:43.378 --> 00:00:46.468
<c.yellow> I think I’m sick.</c.yellow>

26
00:00:46.564 --> 00:00:48.653
I’m sorry to hear that.

27
00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:51.106
 I was sick last week, too.

28
00:00:51.106 --> 00:00:52.468
 I had the flu.

<c.yellow>What did you do?</c.yellow>

33
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.004
I slept a lot and I drank a lot of water.

34
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:00.120
 Do you have a doctor?

<c.yellow>Yes, I do.</c.yellow>

39
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.555
You should call your doctor.

40
00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:05.248
 And get lots of rest!

<c.yellow> I’ll call right now.</c.yellow>

46
00:01:07.418 --> 00:01:10.163
<c.yellow> I'm calling my doctor.</c.yellow>

47
00:01:10.104 --> 00:01:12.876
Now, where does this thing go?

81
