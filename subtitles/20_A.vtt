<c.yellow>Hi, there! Washington, D.C. is a great place to work.</c.yellow>

3
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.297
<c.yellow> Many people here work in government and politics.</c.yellow>

4
00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:11.806
<c.yellow> But there are many other jobs.</c.yellow>

5
00:00:10.805 --> 00:00:15.206
<c.yellow> You can work at a hospital; a university.</c.yellow>

6
00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:17.715
<c.yellow> You can work in a coffee shop.</c.yellow>

7
00:00:16.714 --> 00:00:21.519
<c.yellow> Wait a minute, I think I see a friend of mine.</c.yellow>

85

No, I can’t code! I can’t teach! I can’t cook!
