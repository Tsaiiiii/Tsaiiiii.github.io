Hello!

2
00:00:00.935 --> 00:00:05.920
 In Washington, D.C., there are many places that bring history to life.

3
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.870
 But people who live here often do not have time to see them.

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.898
 They are too busy with work-- like me.

5
00:00:13.898 --> 00:00:14.808
 Hi, Marsha!

<c.yellow>Hi, Anna! Have a seat.</c.yellow>

10
00:00:17.176 --> 00:00:20.087
Thanks. This was a good idea.

11
00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:22.696
 Working outdoors is nice.

<c.yellow>Um-hum, it is.</c.yellow>

16
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.421
I am tired.

17
00:00:26.421 --> 00:00:29.314
 Today was a busy day at work.

18
00:00:29.314 --> 00:00:32.110
 And I still have work to do!

19

<c.yellow>Hmm, that’s too bad.</c.yellow>

23
00:00:34.474 --> 00:00:35.890
How are you these days?

<c.yellow>I'm really busy too, Anna.</c.yellow>

28
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.266
<c.yellow> Let’s get to work.</c.yellow>

29
00:00:39.418 --> 00:00:40.498
Marsha, look!

30
00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:43.906
 That bus has a photo of Abraham Lincoln!

31
00:00:42.518 --> 00:00:43.018

34
00:00:43.018 --> 00:00:47.088
<c.yellow>That’s an advertisement for Ford’s Theatre.</c.yellow>

35
00:00:46.088 --> 00:00:48.658
<c.yellow> They have a new show.</c.yellow>

36
00:00:48.794 --> 00:00:52.290
They have shows where Abraham Lincoln died?

37
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:51.450

<c.yellow>Yeah, it’s a working theater and a museum.</c.yellow>

41
00:00:56.632 --> 00:00:58.980
I love Lincoln.

42
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.984
 You know, Marsha, that advertisement reminds me of something.

<c.yellow>Um-hum. What’s that?</c.yellow>

47
00:01:05.424 --> 00:01:07.436
When I was a little girl…

48
00:01:07.436 --> 00:01:09.529
 When I was a little girl…

49
00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:12.024
 I was not like other children.

<c.yellow>Um-hum, I can believe that.</c.yellow>

54
00:01:14.688 --> 00:01:17.240
I was a tall, serious child.

55
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.350
 At the playground the other children played silly games.

56
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.720
 They played with dart guns.

57
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.430
 They played on the swings, the slide and the teeter-totter.

58
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.780
 They also played ball.

59
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.620
 But not me.

60
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.540
 I loved to read serious books about U.S. presidents.

61
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.855
 In fact, I wanted to be… don’t laugh… President of the United States.

62
00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:48.774
 Stop! I know it’s a silly childhood dream.

<c.yellow>I’m sorry.</c.yellow>

67
00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:51.492
<c.yellow> It’s not silly.</c.yellow>

68
00:01:50.492 --> 00:01:54.000
<c.yellow> Guess what I wanted to be?</c.yellow>

69
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.736
What?

<c.yellow>When I was a kid, I studied the stars and planets.</c.yellow>

74
00:01:58.293 --> 00:02:02.288
<c.yellow> I wanted to fly into outer space!</c.yellow>

75
00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:05.900
You know, Marsha, childhood dreams are really important.

<c.yellow>They are. And it’s good to remember them.</c.yellow>

80
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.848
Hey! I have an idea. Let’s go.

90
00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:28.515
No. We’re going to see a show at Ford’s Theatre just like Abraham Lincoln did when he died!

91

Good point.

Honestly.

103
00:02:41.085 --> 00:02:48.683
 Tonight we are seeing a show at Ford’s Theatre, where a man shot President Abraham Lincoln.

104
00:02:48.683 --> 00:02:53.886
 This is history come to life… and a childhood dream come true!

105

 Until next time…
