00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.250
Hi, there! Washington, D.C. is a great place to work.

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.600
 Many people here work in government and politics.

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.900
 But there are many other jobs.

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.206
 You can work at a hospital; a university.

5
00:00:15.206 --> 00:00:17.715
 You can work in a coffee shop.

6
00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:21.120
 Wait a minute, I think I see a friend of mine.

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.057
 Pete? Is that you?

8
00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:24.285
Hi, Anna.

9
00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:26.761
You look different.

10
00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:29.733
 Your beard … is really big.

11
00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:31.925
You don’t like it, do you?

12
00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:35.600
No, no. You just look … different.

13
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.945
 So, what’s wrong? You look sad.

14
00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:41.225
I don’t have a job.

15
00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:44.185
Sorry, I can’t hear you.

16
00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:47.145
I do not have a job!

17
00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:50.501
Oh. I’m sorry to hear that, Pete.

18
00:00:50.693 --> 00:00:52.145
I don’t have a skill.

19
00:00:52.695 --> 00:00:54.588
Everyone has a skill.

20
00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:56.751
 You need to find yours.

21
00:00:56.903 --> 00:00:57.983
I don’t know, Anna.

22
00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.045
Pete, I am good at asking questions.

23
00:01:01.045 --> 00:01:02.775
 Let me ask you some.

24
00:01:02.935 --> 00:01:03.989
Really, Anna?

25
00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.367
 Can you help me?

26
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:06.362
Yes, I can.

27
00:01:06.362 --> 00:01:07.463
 Let me help.

28
00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:08.440
Sure, Anna.

29
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.367
 Maybe you can help me.

30
00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:12.719
Can you write code?

31
00:01:12.887 --> 00:01:16.460
Sure, C-O-L-D.

32
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.515
 How is this going to help?

33
00:01:18.955 --> 00:01:20.339
No, not “cold.”

34
00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:25.139
 Code; you know, for making phone apps, or websites.

35
00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:28.923
 You can make tons of money writing code.

36
00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:30.338
Tons of money?

37
00:01:30.338 --> 00:01:32.035
 But I can’t code.

38
00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:33.477
Next question.

39
00:01:33.477 --> 00:01:34.851
 Can you drive?

40
00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:36.607
Do you mean drive a race car?

41
00:01:36.607 --> 00:01:38.929
 It’s really hard to be a race car driver.

42
00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:40.643
 First, you need a race car ...

43
00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:44.447
No, I mean drive a taxi or drive a bus.

44
00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:47.527
No, I always fall asleep when I drive.

45
00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:49.584
Oh, that’s not good.

46
00:01:49.584 --> 00:01:52.514
 Next question. Can you teach?

47
00:01:52.514 --> 00:01:55.835
 You can be a teacher in a school.

48
00:01:56.495 --> 00:01:58.395
No, I cannot teach.

49
00:01:58.695 --> 00:01:59.668
Can you cook?

50
00:01:59.668 --> 00:02:02.287
 You can be a chef in a restaurant.

51
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:05.875
No, I can’t code! I can’t teach! I can’t cook!

52
00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:09.720
 Anna, I can’t do anything. This is sad.

53
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.315
 I’m gonna write about my feelings in my blog.

54
00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:14.665
You write a blog?

55
00:02:14.825 --> 00:02:16.209
Yeah, I write a blog.

56
00:02:16.377 --> 00:02:18.521
How many followers do you have?

57
00:02:18.673 --> 00:02:21.849
I don’t know … 59,538.

58
00:02:21.977 --> 00:02:24.533
Pete, that's a lot of followers!

59
00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:26.769
 You can make money writing!

60
00:02:26.937 --> 00:02:28.213
Writing is easy.

61
00:02:28.213 --> 00:02:29.729
 Everyone can write.

62
00:02:29.817 --> 00:02:32.258
Not everyone can write well.

63
00:02:32.258 --> 00:02:34.089
 You can be a writer!

64
00:02:34.257 --> 00:02:35.709
I can be a writer.

65
00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.242
 I can be a writer!

66
00:02:37.242 --> 00:02:38.775
 I can be a writer!

67
00:02:38.775 --> 00:02:39.905
 Thanks, Anna.

68
00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:41.993
Hi, Pete. Hi, Anna.

69
00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.017
Hi, Marsha. Excuse me, I have to go.

70
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:46.281
Where are you going?

71
00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:49.145
I’m going to be a writer!

72
00:02:49.305 --> 00:02:50.572
Good luck, Pete!

73
00:02:50.572 --> 00:02:55.325
 He does know that it’s not easy to be a writer, doesn’t he?

74
00:02:55.785 --> 00:03:00.872
There are many different jobs you can have in Washington, D.C.

75
00:03:00.872 --> 00:03:03.087
 Pete wants to be a writer.

76
00:03:03.087 --> 00:03:05.630
 I wish him luck. Lots of luck.

77
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.025
 Until next time!
