00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:08.442
Hello! I am sure that today, in Washington, D.C., there are a lot of great things to do.

2
00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:11.366
 But I am not doing any of them.

3
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.372
 I am sick.

4
00:00:12.372 --> 00:00:19.317
 Right now, I'm going to call my boss and tell her I cannot come in to work.

<c.yellow>Hello?</c.yellow>

9
00:00:21.014 --> 00:00:22.348
Ms. Weaver, Hi.

10
00:00:22.348 --> 00:00:24.839
 I can’t come to work today.

<c.yellow>Why not? What is wrong?</c.yellow>

15
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.617
Well, yesterday I felt fine.

16
00:00:29.617 --> 00:00:32.969
 In the morning, I painted for hours.

17
00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.687
 In the afternoon, I cut wood.

18
00:00:35.687 --> 00:00:37.680
 Then, I built a fire.

<c.yellow>Anna, what do you mean?</c.yellow>

23
00:00:38.651 --> 00:00:42.004
<c.yellow> Why can’t you come to work today?</c.yellow>

24
00:00:42.172 --> 00:00:44.378
I do not feel well.

25
00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:46.468
 I think I’m sick.

<c.yellow>I’m sorry to hear that.</c.yellow>

30
00:00:47.652 --> 00:00:51.106
<c.yellow> I was sick last week, too.</c.yellow>

31
00:00:50.106 --> 00:00:52.468
<c.yellow> I had the flu.</c.yellow>

32
00:00:52.644 --> 00:00:53.940
What did you do?

<c.yellow>I slept a lot and I drank a lot of water.</c.yellow>

37
00:00:57.003 --> 00:01:00.120
<c.yellow> Do you have a doctor?</c.yellow>

38
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.280
Yes, I do.

<c.yellow>You should call your doctor.</c.yellow>

43
00:01:02.554 --> 00:01:05.248
<c.yellow> And get lots of rest!</c.yellow>

44
00:01:05.384 --> 00:01:06.825
Thanks, Ms. Weaver.

45
00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:08.418
 I’ll call right now.

46
00:01:08.418 --> 00:01:10.163

65
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.184
<c.yellow> Do you have a sore throat?</c.yellow>

This morning.

77
00:01:39.893 --> 00:01:42.059
 Yesterday I felt great.

78
00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:45.399
 In the morning I painted, for hours-

79
00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.016
 in the afternoon I cut wood-

<c.yellow> But I don’t need to know all that.</c.yellow>

85
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.222

103

<c.yellow> Rest in bed and get lots of sleep.</c.yellow>

<c.yellow> Call me back in a couple of days.</c.yellow>

116
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.417
I will, Dr. Bennett. And thanks.

117
00:02:40.417 --> 00:02:46.213
 Well, you heard the doctor– no work for a couple of days.

118
00:02:46.213 --> 00:02:50.609
 I need water, sleep and um… lots of movies!

119
00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:55.705
 Well, the doctor didn’t say anything about movies.

120
00:02:55.705 --> 00:02:57.603
 But it can’t hurt!

121
00:02:57.603 --> 00:02:59.302
 Until next time!
