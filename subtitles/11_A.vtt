00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:14.748
<c.yellow> Marsha, before we get ice cream, I need to return three books to the library</c.yellow>

5
00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:16.725
<c.yellow> Where is the library?</c.yellow>

6
00:00:17.065 --> 00:00:20.449
It is on this street on the corner

Um, no

24
00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:47.973
 The post office is far from here

25
00:00:47.973 --> 00:00:51.697
