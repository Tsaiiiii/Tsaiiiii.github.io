00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.787
<c.yellow>Hello from Washington, DC!</c.yellow>

2
00:00:01.786 --> 00:00:06.953
<c.yellow> This city has many monuments and memorials.</c.yellow>

3
00:00:05.953 --> 00:00:14.820
<c.yellow> Today I am visiting the ones built in memory of our Presidents: Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt.</c.yellow>

4
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.560
<c.yellow> I want to learn more about them.</c.yellow>

5
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.008
<c.yellow> Hey! Watch out!</c.yellow>

6
00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:24.312
Sorry! I didn't see you.

10
00:00:23.495 --> 00:00:25.939
<c.yellow>You were not looking.</c.yellow>

11
00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.862
<c.yellow> You should be more careful.</c.yellow>

12
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:30.000
I know I should be more careful.

13
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.806
 But this game is really fun.

17
00:00:31.957 --> 00:00:34.614
<c.yellow>What kind of game?</c.yellow>

18
00:00:34.782 --> 00:00:38.370
You have to find things that aren't really there.

19
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.670

<c.yellow>How can you find things that aren’t really there?</c.yellow>

23
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.278
They're in your phone. See?

<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

27
00:00:43.414 --> 00:00:48.470
<c.yellow>I see. It’s like a scavenger hunt.</c.yellow>

28
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.430
That’s right!

29
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.550

32
00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:51.715
<c.yellow>I don’t have time for games.</c.yellow>

33
00:00:50.715 --> 00:00:54.730
<c.yellow> I want to learn about U.S. presidents.</c.yellow>

34
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.760
Then you should play this game!

35
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:05.170
 When you find an American symbol, you win points and a Fun Fact about a U.S. President.

<c.yellow>I have time for this game!</c.yellow>

40
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.778
Here are the symbols that I caught:

41
00:01:11.778 --> 00:01:22.050
 the Statue of Liberty for 20 points, Uncle Sam for 40 points and the American flag for 60 points.

<c.yellow>What symbol are you looking for now?</c.yellow>

46
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.524
I am looking for the bald eagle.

47
00:01:27.524 --> 00:01:29.338
 That is 100 points!

48
00:01:29.338 --> 00:01:33.240
 It should be near the Washington Monument.

49
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.740

<c.yellow>This game is awesome.</c.yellow>

53
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.402
You ought to buy the app right now.

54
00:01:40.402 --> 00:01:43.044
 It’s called “Catch Americana.”

<c.yellow>This is the Jefferson Memorial.</c.yellow>

65
00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:57.540
<c.yellow> I know that Thomas Jefferson signed the Declaration of Independence!</c.yellow>

66
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.750
<c.yellow> Now, where is that symbol?</c.yellow>

67
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.070
<c.yellow> Here it is! My first one.</c.yellow>

68
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.892
<c.yellow> It’s an American flag! I won 60 points!</c.yellow>

69
00:02:05.891 --> 00:02:11.097
<c.yellow> An American flag works well for Thomas Jefferson.</c.yellow>

70
00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:15.303
<c.yellow> I see lots of American flags on Independence Day!</c.yellow>

71
00:02:14.302 --> 00:02:17.994
<c.yellow> Where is my Jefferson Fun Fact?</c.yellow>

72
00:02:18.162 --> 00:02:22.746

<c.yellow>I did not know that.</c.yellow>

77

<c.yellow> Where is the next symbol?</c.yellow>
