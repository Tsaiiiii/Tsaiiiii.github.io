00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.730
Marsha and I invited friends to a dinner party but I shopped with the wrong list.

2
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.770
 Guests are coming soon.

3
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.470
 Marsha is worried but I have a plan.

4
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.970
 Let’s see what it is.

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.673
 I just need a couple of ingredients.

6
00:00:18.673 --> 00:00:21.340
 Marsha, please hand me the flour.

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.520
Anna, where is the flour?

8
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.440
 It's not in the cabinets.

9
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.180
I put the flour inside the refrigerator.

10
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.530
Why?

11
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.954
It’s cold and dry in the refrigerator.

12
00:00:33.954 --> 00:00:37.142
 See, it says: “Put in a cold, dry place.”

13
00:00:37.326 --> 00:00:38.330
Okay.

14
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.330
Now, Marsha, please hand me the eggs.

15
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.290
Anna, where are the eggs?

16
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.690
The eggs are inside the cabinet under the sink.

17
00:00:49.896 --> 00:00:54.450
Why are the eggs in here?

18
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.263
On the farm, we always put the eggs there.

19
00:00:58.263 --> 00:01:01.068
 How else can the chickens see them?

20
00:01:01.068 --> 00:01:03.030
 Okay. You clean the living room.

21
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.198
 I will make dinner.

22
00:01:05.374 --> 00:01:08.686
What are you going to make with these ingredients?

23
00:01:08.878 --> 00:01:10.810
I have a plan.

24
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.152
Okay, the apartment is clean.

25
00:01:14.152 --> 00:01:16.720
 The kitchen is not.

26
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.210
 What are you cooking?

27
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.450
I made my favorite recipe: peanut-butter-banana pancakes!

28
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.186
You made breakfast.

29
00:01:27.378 --> 00:01:31.714
Yes! I call it let’s-eat-breakfast-for-dinner dinner!

30
00:01:32.283 --> 00:01:33.201
Anna!

31
00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:39.850
 Mmm! Hey, this tastes good!

32
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.750
 Anna, you made it work!

33
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.703
That’s our guests!

34
00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:46.091
I’ll answer the door.

35
00:01:46.046 --> 00:01:47.570
I'll finish here.

36
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.270
 Like I said, sometimes Marsha worries too much.

37
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.607
 When something goes wrong with your plan, just change the plan!

38
00:01:57.607 --> 00:01:59.041
 Till next time!
