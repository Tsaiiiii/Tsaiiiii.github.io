00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.612
Hello, from Washington, D.C.!

2
00:00:02.612 --> 00:00:07.657
 Today at work I am reading the news for the first time.

3
00:00:07.657 --> 00:00:09.549
 I am really nervous.

4
00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.603
 But my boss, Ms. Weaver, is here to help me.

5
00:00:14.353 --> 00:00:16.060
Now, Anna, remember.

6
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.412
 When we read the news we are always reading facts.

7
00:00:20.412 --> 00:00:22.801
 We never show our feelings.

8
00:00:22.953 --> 00:00:24.425
Sure thing, Ms. Weaver.

9
00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:26.495
Great. Are you ready?

10
00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:29.723
Yes.

11
00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.415
Okay, let’s try the first story!

12
00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:38.842
Hello, and welcome to The News.

13
00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:44.957
 A new book is very popular with children and families.

14
00:00:44.957 --> 00:00:50.330
 This is it. It is about a lost duckling.

15
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.407
 The duck's mother cannot find him.

16
00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:54.090
Stop!

17
00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:02.435
 Anna, when you say the words “duck” and “duckling” you look really sad.

18
00:01:02.775 --> 00:01:03.791
I do?

19
00:01:03.983 --> 00:01:06.743
Yes. Sad is a feeling.

20
00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:08.724
Sad is not a fact.

21
00:01:08.724 --> 00:01:11.231
 Sorry. Let me try again.

22
00:01:11.423 --> 00:01:13.614
Okay, she’s trying again!

23
00:01:13.614 --> 00:01:14.315
 And go.

24
00:01:17.335 --> 00:01:20.542
Hello, and welcome to The News.

25
00:01:20.542 --> 00:01:26.233
 A new book is very popular with children and families.

26
00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:27.474
 This is it.

27
00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:32.110
 It is about a lost duckling.

28
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.200
 The duck’s mother can not find him.

29
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.407
 But a family gives him a home.

30
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:38.037
Stop!

31
00:01:38.037 --> 00:01:40.955
 Anna, you are doing it again.

32
00:01:42.055 --> 00:01:44.835
This story is very sad.

33
00:01:45.575 --> 00:01:46.645
I have an idea.

34
00:01:46.645 --> 00:01:48.713
 Let’s read the second story.

35
00:01:48.713 --> 00:01:50.996
 She’s reading the second story.

36
00:01:50.996 --> 00:01:51.709
 And … go!

37
00:01:51.837 --> 00:01:55.053
Hello, and welcome to The News.

38
00:01:55.053 --> 00:02:03.561
 In Indiana, a grandmother is the first 80-year-old woman to win The Race Car 500.

39
00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:05.325
 That is awesome!

40
00:02:05.445 --> 00:02:08.180
Stop! Stop!

41
00:02:08.180s --> 00:02:11.957
 Anna, please -- no feelings.

42
00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:12.674
Right.

43
00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:18.627
 But it is awesome that an 80-year-old grandmother wins a car race.

44
00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:21.415
Just the facts, Anna.

45
00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:23.491
Right.

46
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.860
 Hello, and welcome to The News.

47
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:38.190
 In Indiana, a grandmother is the first 80-year-old woman to win The Race Car 500.

48
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.950
 She rarely talks to reporters.

49
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.370
 But when she does,

50
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.113
 she often says, “Nothing can stop me now!”

51
00:02:46.113 --> 00:02:48.845
 I am very happy for her!

52
00:02:48.746 --> 00:02:50.866
Stop, stop, stop!!

53
00:02:50.866 --> 00:02:55.105
 Anna, you cannot say you are happy.

54
00:02:55.525 --> 00:02:56.805
But I am happy.

55
00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.605
But you can’t say it.

56
00:02:58.725 --> 00:02:59.385
Why?

57
00:02:59.845 --> 00:03:01.484
This is the News.

58
00:03:01.484 --> 00:03:04.183
 Happy and sad are feelings.

59
00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:07.365
 You can’t have them in The News.

60
00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:11.005
Okay. I got it.

61
00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:15.940
Okay. Let’s try the third story.

62
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.377
 She’s reading the third story!

63
00:03:18.561 --> 00:03:22.240
Hello and welcome to The News.

64
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:31.270
 City politicians in Big Town are using city money to have a big party on a cruise ship.

65
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.554
 They are taking the money for the party from the children’s library.

66
00:03:36.554 --> 00:03:39.729
 What?! That makes me very angry.

67
00:03:39.597 --> 00:03:40.731
No, no, no!

68
00:03:40.731 --> 00:03:44.443
 Anna, you cannot say you are angry!

69
00:03:44.443 --> 00:03:46.505
 This is The News!!!

70
00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:48.629
What can I do, Ms. Weaver?

71
00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.790
 Take out my feelings and put them here …

72
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.177
 on the news desk?

73
00:03:53.241 --> 00:03:55.530
Yes. Yes. That’s right!

74
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.420
 Now you’ve got it!

75
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.405
 Let’s repeat the first story.

76
00:04:01.415 --> 00:04:04.864
This is going to be a very long day.

77
00:04:04.864 --> 00:04:06.493
 Until next time!
