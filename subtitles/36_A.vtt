00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:06.730
<c.yellow>Marsha and I invited friends to a dinner party but I shopped with the wrong list.</c.yellow>

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.770
<c.yellow> Guests are coming soon.</c.yellow>

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.470
<c.yellow> Marsha is worried but I have a plan.</c.yellow>

4
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.970
<c.yellow> Let’s see what it is.</c.yellow>

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.673
<c.yellow> I just need a couple of ingredients.</c.yellow>

6
00:00:17.672 --> 00:00:21.340
<c.yellow> Marsha, please hand me the flour.</c.yellow>

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.520
Anna, where is the flour?

8
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.440
 It's not in the cabinets.

9
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.520
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

10
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.020
<c.yellow>●●</c.yellow>

<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

12
00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.180
<c.yellow>I put the flour inside the refrigerator.</c.yellow>

13
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.530
Why?

14
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.070

<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

17
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.954
<c.yellow>It’s cold and dry in the refrigerator.</c.yellow>

18
00:00:32.954 --> 00:00:37.142
<c.yellow> See, it says: “Put in a cold, dry place.”</c.yellow>

19
00:00:35.826 --> 00:00:36.326
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

22
00:00:36.326 --> 00:00:38.330
<c.yellow>Okay.</c.yellow>

<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

26
00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.330
<c.yellow>Now, Marsha, please hand me the eggs.</c.yellow>

27
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.290
Anna, where are the eggs?

28
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.630

31
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.690
<c.yellow>The eggs are inside the cabinet under the sink.</c.yellow>

32
00:00:49.896 --> 00:00:54.450
Why are the eggs in here?

33
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.990
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.490

<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

36
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.263
<c.yellow>On the farm, we always put the eggs there.</c.yellow>

37
00:00:57.262 --> 00:01:01.068
<c.yellow> How else can the chickens see them?</c.yellow>

38
00:01:00.067 --> 00:01:03.030
<c.yellow> Okay. You clean the living room.</c.yellow>

39
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.198
<c.yellow> I will make dinner.</c.yellow>

40
00:01:05.374 --> 00:01:08.686
What are you going to make with these ingredients?

41
00:01:07.378 --> 00:01:07.878

<c.yellow>I have a plan.</c.yellow>

45
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.152
Okay, the apartment is clean.

46
00:01:14.152 --> 00:01:16.720
 The kitchen is not.

47
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.210
 What are you cooking?

48
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.630

51
00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:24.450
<c.yellow>I made my favorite recipe: peanut-butter-banana pancakes!</c.yellow>

52
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.186
You made breakfast.

<c.yellow>Yes! I call it let’s-eat-breakfast-for-dinner dinner!</c.yellow>

57
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.201
Anna!

58
00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:39.850
 Mmm! Hey, this tastes good!

59
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.750
 Anna, you made it work!

<c.yellow>That’s our guests!</c.yellow>

64
00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:46.091
I’ll answer the door.

68
00:01:45.046 --> 00:01:47.570
<c.yellow>I'll finish here.</c.yellow>

69
00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:52.270
<c.yellow> Like I said, sometimes Marsha worries too much.</c.yellow>

70
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.607
<c.yellow> When something goes wrong with your plan, just change the plan!</c.yellow>

71
00:01:56.606 --> 00:01:59.041
<c.yellow> Till next time!</c.yellow>
