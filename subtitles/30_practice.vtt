00:00:00.421 --> 00:00:04.822
Hello! Washington, D.C. sits on the Potomac River.

2
00:00:04.822 --> 00:00:10.455
 This river is important to the history and culture of the city.

3
00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:16.176
 Today, I am at an outdoor seafood market near the Potomac River.

4
00:00:16.176 --> 00:00:22.425
 Some say it is the oldest outdoor seafood market in the United States!

5
00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:24.713
 I am here to buy seafood.

6
00:00:24.713 --> 00:00:27.002
 Let’s see what they have!

7
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.466
 Excuse me. Can you help me?

8
00:00:29.618 --> 00:00:31.216
Sure! What do you need?

9
00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:32.199
Pete!

10
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:33.181
Anna!

11
00:00:33.274 --> 00:00:35.082
What are you doing here?

12
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.328
I work here.

13
00:00:36.328 --> 00:00:39.866
 You know, it’s not easy to be a writer.

14
00:00:39.978 --> 00:00:42.811
Yeah, I heard that. Sorry.

15
00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:45.251
But this job is great.

16
00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:48.150
 I work outside by the river.

17
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.450
 And I can eat all the free seafood I want!

18
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.222
That is great, Pete.

19
00:00:54.222 --> 00:00:59.058
 In fact, I am here to buy some seafood for my dinner party.

20
00:00:59.194 --> 00:01:01.011
You came to the right place.

21
00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:03.607
 They have the freshest seafood in town.

22
00:01:03.607 --> 00:01:05.554
 How much money can you spend?

23
00:01:05.682 --> 00:01:08.710
I can only spend $50.

24
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.230
Okay. What do you want?

25
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.870
First, I want to buy some shrimp.

26
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.015
Sure thing. Follow me.

27
00:01:18.015 --> 00:01:21.080
 How much shrimp do you want?

28
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.680
How much do I need for five people?

29
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.440
Give her a pound of shrimp!

30
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.600
Ok, now I want to buy some crabs.

31
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.579
The crabs here are delicious!

32
00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:42.767
 They are the best because they come from the nearby Chesapeake Bay!

33
00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:44.132
 Walk this way.

34
00:01:44.132 --> 00:01:46.680
 How many crabs do you want?

35
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.692
I want a dozen crabs.

36
00:01:49.836 --> 00:01:52.270
You should get the larger crabs.

37
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.172
 They have the most meat.

38
00:01:54.316 --> 00:01:58.920
Then I want a dozen large crabs, please!

39
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.908
Is that everything you need?

40
00:02:01.044 --> 00:02:04.337
Let’s see… I have shrimp and crabs.

41
00:02:04.337 --> 00:02:10.640
 And a friend is bringing a salad and many ears of corn-on-the-cob.

42
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.710
Is that all the seafood that you need?

43
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.590
Yes.

44
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.062
That’ll be $49.95.

45
00:02:17.062 --> 00:02:19.118
 Cash or credit?

46
00:02:19.214 --> 00:02:20.410
Credit, please.

47
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.522
Anna, you love to eat seafood.

48
00:02:23.522 --> 00:02:26.014
 Did you grow up on the water?

49
00:02:26.182 --> 00:02:27.361
No, I didn’t.

50
00:02:27.361 --> 00:02:29.357
 But I love the water.

51
00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:32.170
 And I love being on the water.

52
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.290
You know how to sail?

53
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.450
Well … this afternoon I am going on a boat.

54
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.381
You are full of surprises.

55
00:02:41.381 --> 00:02:43.041
 What kind of boat?

56
00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:45.924
 Is it a motorboat or a sailboat?

57
00:02:46.052 --> 00:02:48.415
It’s a special boat, Pete.

58
00:02:48.415 --> 00:02:50.961
 Well, thanks for your help.

59
00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:52.324
 See you later!

60
00:02:52.492 --> 00:02:54.059
See you, Anna!

61
00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:56.521
 Wow, Anna’s a sailor!

62
00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:57.640
 Who knew?

63
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.305
Yes, rivers are important to the history and culture of Washington, D.C.

64
00:03:05.305 --> 00:03:10.834
 And now I am part of this city’s interesting waterfront culture.

65
00:03:10.834 --> 00:03:12.280
 Until next time!
