00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.628
Hi there!

2
00:00:01.628 --> 00:00:06.166
 Washington, D.C. has many fun places to eat.

3
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:09.999
 But, sometimes it's more fun to cook.

4
00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:14.330
 In fact, tonight Marsha and I are cooking for friends.

5
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.930
 Well, she is cooking.

6
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.287
 I am doing the shopping.

7
00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:21.598
 It’s Marsha.

8
00:00:21.598 --> 00:00:22.808
 Hi, Marsha.

9
00:00:22.984 --> 00:00:25.848
Hi, Anna. Do you have the shopping list?

10
00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:29.434
Yes, I told you: I have the shopping list.

11
00:00:29.434 --> 00:00:30.830
 Can you hear it?

12
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.554
Okay, good. I hear the list.

13
00:00:33.554 --> 00:00:38.114
 Anna, please buy all the ingredients on the list.

14
00:00:38.282 --> 00:00:40.190
Yes, Marsha, I will.

15
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.990
And do not spend too much time shopping.

16
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.277
No, Marsha, I won’t.

17
00:00:46.277 --> 00:00:47.737
 See you later.

18
00:00:47.737 --> 00:00:51.240
 Sometimes, Marsha worries too much.

19
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.895
 I love shopping!

20
00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:56.496
 And, I did not spend too much money.

21
00:00:56.496 --> 00:01:00.292
 Oh, no! But I did spend too much time!

22
00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:02.920
 I have to return home now!

23
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.646
Anna, what took you so long?

24
00:01:06.646 --> 00:01:09.116
 Our guests will be here soon!

25
00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:10.797
Don’t worry, Marsha.

26
00:01:10.797 --> 00:01:13.320
 I bought everything on the list.

27
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.570
Let me see.

28
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:25.942
 You bought a bunch of bananas, a box of pancake mix, a bag of coffee…

29
00:01:25.942 --> 00:01:29.646
 Anna, this is all wrong!

30
00:01:29.838 --> 00:01:31.360
What do you mean wrong?

31
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:42.318
 I bought a jar of peanut butter and a loaf of bread… no, wait… two loaves of bread.

32
00:01:42.494 --> 00:01:46.286
Anna, these are the wrong ingredients!

33
00:01:46.478 --> 00:01:49.893
These ingredients are all on the list!

34
00:01:49.893 --> 00:01:53.038
 I took this list from the counter.

35
00:01:53.214 --> 00:01:58.190
Anna, this is the shopping list for breakfast.

36
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:05.006
 I said, take the shopping list on the refrigerator for dinner!

37
00:02:05.198 --> 00:02:11.118
Marsha, there was no shopping list on the refrigerator for dinner!

38
00:02:11.294 --> 00:02:14.725
Oh no! It’s on the floor!!

39
00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:18.024
 What are we going to do?

40
00:02:18.192 --> 00:02:20.280
When do our guests arrive?

41
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.500
They arrive in 30 minutes!

42
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.719
I can fix this.

43
00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:27.576
 Do you trust me?

44
00:02:27.728 --> 00:02:29.060
Do I have to?

45
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.859
Yes.
