Hi there. Washington, D.C. has many fun places to eat. But sometimes it's more fun to cook. In fact, tonight Marcia and I are cooking for friends. Well, she is cooking. I am doing the shopping. It's Marcia. Hi, Marcia.

2
00:00:22.984 --> 00:00:25.848
Hi, Anna. Do you have the shopping list?

3
00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:30.830
Yes, I told you I have the shopping list. Can you hear it?

4
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.114
Okay, good. I hear the list. Ana, please buy all the ingredients on the list.

5
00:00:38.282 --> 00:00:40.190
Yes, Marcia, I will.

6
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.990
And do not spend too much time shopping.

7
00:00:44.330 --> 00:01:02.920
No, Marcia, I won't See you later. Sometimes Marcia worries too much. I love shopping. And I did not spend too much money. Oh, no. But I did spend too much time. I have to return home now.

8
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.116
Anna, what took you so long? Our guests will be here soon.

9
00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:13.320
Don't worry. Marcia, I bought everything on the list.

10
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:29.646
Let me see. You bought a bunch of bananas, a box of a pancake mix, a bag of coffee. Anna, this is all wrong.

11
00:01:29.838 --> 00:01:42.318
What do you mean, wrong? I bought a jar of peanut butter and a loaf of bread. No, wait. Two loaves of bread.

12
00:01:42.494 --> 00:01:46.286
Anna, these are the wrong ingredients.

13
00:01:46.478 --> 00:01:53.038
These ingredients are all on the list. I took this list from the counter.

14
00:01:53.214 --> 00:02:05.006
Anna, this is the shopping list for breakfast. I said take the shopping list on the refrigerator for dinner.

15
00:02:05.198 --> 00:02:11.118
Marcia, there was no shopping list on the refrigerator for dinner.

16
00:02:11.294 --> 00:02:18.024
Oh, no. It's on the floor. What are we going to do?

17
00:02:18.192 --> 00:02:20.280
When do our guests arrive?

18
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.500
They arrive in 30 minutes.

19
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.576
I can fix this. Do you trust me?

20
00:02:27.728 --> 00:02:29.060
Do I have to?

21
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.640
Yes.
