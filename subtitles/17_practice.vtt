00:00:02.057 --> 00:00:02.815
Hi there.

2
00:00:02.815 --> 00:00:06.856
 Things are going really well in Washington, DC.

3
00:00:06.856 --> 00:00:09.466
 This city is very interesting,

4
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:13.844
 I really like my job, and I have some good friends!

5
00:00:13.844 --> 00:00:16.100
 Speaking of friends … I see one now!

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.969
 Marsha! Hi!

7
00:00:18.137 --> 00:00:20.385
Hi, Anna. What’s going on?

8
00:00:20.545 --> 00:00:21.238
Not much.

9
00:00:21.238 --> 00:00:22.393
 How about you?

10
00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:23.626
Busy as usual.

11
00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:26.793
 Hey, do you wanna see a movie with me?

12
00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:27.707
Sure!

13
00:00:27.707 --> 00:00:31.147
 I never have time to see a movie.

14
00:00:31.147 --> 00:00:31.754
 When?

15
00:00:31.953 --> 00:00:35.605
Are you busy this Thursday at 6pm?

16
00:00:35.604 --> 00:00:36.874
Let’s see …

17
00:00:36.874 --> 00:00:44.497
 I’m busy. I am going to tap dance with my friends Thursday night.

18
00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:47.025
Tap dancing? That sounds fun!

19
00:00:47.145 --> 00:00:48.825
I’m still learning.

20
00:00:48.825 --> 00:00:50.152
 But it is fun!

21
00:00:50.152 --> 00:00:52.805
 Are you busy on Friday night?

22
00:00:53.305 --> 00:00:57.033
Yes. Friday nights are when I visit my parents.

23
00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:59.537
What do you and your family do together?

24
00:00:59.721 --> 00:01:04.713
We always eat dinner together and sometimes we play board games.

25
00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:07.312
Playing board games is fun, too!

26
00:01:07.312 --> 00:01:10.265
 The word game Scrabble is my favorite.

27
00:01:10.425 --> 00:01:12.245
I like Connect Four!

28
00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:14.958
I’m not busy Monday night.

29
00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:15.765
 Are you?

30
00:01:16.385 --> 00:01:18.612
I am busy on Monday night.

31
00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:22.467
 I’m going to jog in the park with my friend.

32
00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:23.495
 Do you jog?

33
00:01:23.655 --> 00:01:25.766
Oh! I always jog.

34
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:28.621
 Well, sometimes I jog.

35
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.980
 Okay, I never jog.

36
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.319
 But I will try because it is good for you.

37
00:01:36.487 --> 00:01:39.596
I always feel great after I jog.

38
00:01:39.596 --> 00:01:42.511
 How about on Wednesday night?

39
00:01:42.663 --> 00:01:45.175
Wednesday night I am not busy.

40
00:01:45.175 --> 00:01:46.347
 Oh, no, wait.

41
00:01:46.347 --> 00:01:49.445
 This Wednesday night I will be busy.

42
00:01:49.825 --> 00:01:50.985
What are you doing?

43
00:01:51.105 --> 00:01:54.565
I’m going to teach children how to play the ukulele.

44
00:01:55.465 --> 00:01:58.529
The world does need more ukulele players.

45
00:01:58.697 --> 00:02:05.102
Marsha, it looks like we’ll never have time to see a movie.

46
00:02:05.102 --> 00:02:08.685
 Wait a minute. Are you busy now?

47
00:02:09.585 --> 00:02:11.526
It’s Saturday afternoon.

48
00:02:11.526 --> 00:02:14.519
 This is always when I do my errands.

49
00:02:14.647 --> 00:02:20.315
Okay, but the new Star Wars movie is gonna start in 30 minutes.

50
00:02:20.775 --> 00:02:23.080
I’ll do my errands on Sunday.

51
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.875
 Let’s go!

52
00:02:25.095 --> 00:02:28.450
Most days of the week, people are really busy.

53
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.607
 But it’s important to find time to be with your friends!

54
00:02:32.607 --> 00:02:33.847
 Until next time!
