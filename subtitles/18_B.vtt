Hello, from Washington, D.C.!

2
00:00:02.612 --> 00:00:07.657
 Today at work I am reading the news for the first time.

3
00:00:07.657 --> 00:00:09.549
 I am really nervous.

4
00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.603
 But my boss, Ms. Weaver, is here to help me.

00:00:12.853 --> 00:00:13.353

00:00:13.352 --> 00:00:16.060
<c.yellow>Now, Anna, remember.</c.yellow>

9
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.412
<c.yellow> When we read the news we are always reading facts.</c.yellow>

10
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:22.801
<c.yellow> We never show our feelings.</c.yellow>

11
00:00:22.953 --> 00:00:24.425
Sure thing, Ms. Weaver.

12
00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:23.585

15
00:00:23.585 --> 00:00:26.495
<c.yellow>Great. Are you ready?</c.yellow>

16
00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:29.723
Yes.

17
00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.859

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.415
<c.yellow>Okay, let’s try the first story!</c.yellow>

21
00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:38.842
Hello, and welcome to The News.

22
00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:44.957
 A new book is very popular with children and families.

23
00:00:44.957 --> 00:00:50.330
 This is it. It is about a lost duckling.

24
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.407
 The duck's mother cannot find him.

25
00:00:52.011 --> 00:00:52.511
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

26
00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:53.011

28
00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:54.090
<c.yellow>Stop!</c.yellow>

29
00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:02.435
<c.yellow> Anna, when you say the words “duck” and “duckling” you look really sad.</c.yellow>

30
00:01:02.775 --> 00:01:03.791
I do?

31
00:01:02.483 --> 00:01:02.983
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

32
00:01:02.983 --> 00:01:03.483

<c.yellow>●</c.yellow>

34
00:01:02.982 --> 00:01:06.743
<c.yellow>Yes. Sad is a feeling.</c.yellow>

35
00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:08.724
Sad is not a fact.

36
00:01:08.724 --> 00:01:11.231
 Sorry. Let me try again.

37
00:01:09.923 --> 00:01:10.423
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

00:01:10.423 --> 00:01:10.923

40
00:01:10.423 --> 00:01:13.614
<c.yellow>Okay, she’s trying again!</c.yellow>

41
00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:14.315
<c.yellow> And go.</c.yellow>

42
00:01:17.335 --> 00:01:20.542
Hello, and welcome to The News.

43
00:01:20.542 --> 00:01:26.233
 A new book is very popular with children and families.

44
00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:27.474
 This is it.

45
00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:32.110
 It is about a lost duckling.

46
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.200
 The duck’s mother can not find him.

47
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.407
 But a family gives him a home.

48
00:01:36.051 --> 00:01:36.551

<c.yellow>Stop!</c.yellow>

52
00:01:37.037 --> 00:01:40.955
<c.yellow> Anna, you are doing it again.</c.yellow>

53
00:01:42.055 --> 00:01:44.835
This story is very sad.

54
00:01:44.075 --> 00:01:44.575
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

57
00:01:44.575 --> 00:01:46.645
<c.yellow>I have an idea.</c.yellow>

58
00:01:45.644 --> 00:01:48.713
<c.yellow> Let’s read the second story.</c.yellow>

59
00:01:47.712 --> 00:01:50.996
<c.yellow> She’s reading the second story.</c.yellow>

60
00:01:49.995 --> 00:01:51.709
<c.yellow> And … go!</c.yellow>

61
00:01:51.837 --> 00:01:55.053
Hello, and welcome to The News.

62
00:01:55.053 --> 00:02:03.561
 In Indiana, a grandmother is the first 80-year-old woman to win The Race Car 500.

63
00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:05.325
 That is awesome!

<c.yellow>Stop! Stop!</c.yellow>

68
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.957
<c.yellow> Anna, please -- no feelings.</c.yellow>

69
00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:12.674
Right.

70
00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:18.627
 But it is awesome that an 80-year-old grandmother wins a car race.

71
00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:17.811

<c.yellow>Just the facts, Anna.</c.yellow>

75
00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:23.491
Right.

76
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.860
 Hello, and welcome to The News.

77
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:38.190
 In Indiana, a grandmother is the first 80-year-old woman to win The Race Car 500.

78
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.950
 She rarely talks to reporters.

79
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.370
 But when she does,

80
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.113
 she often says, “Nothing can stop me now!”

81
00:02:46.113 --> 00:02:48.845
 I am very happy for her!

00:02:47.246 --> 00:02:47.746

<c.yellow>Stop, stop, stop!!</c.yellow>

86
00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:55.105
<c.yellow> Anna, you cannot say you are happy.</c.yellow>

87
00:02:55.525 --> 00:02:56.805
But I am happy.

88
00:02:55.385 --> 00:02:55.885

<c.yellow>But you can’t say it.</c.yellow>

92
00:02:58.725 --> 00:02:59.385
Why?

<c.yellow> Happy and sad are feelings.</c.yellow>

98

<c.yellow> You can’t have them in The News.</c.yellow>

99
00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:11.005

Hello and welcome to The News.

106
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:31.270
 City politicians in Big Town are using city money to have a big party on a cruise ship.

107
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.554
 They are taking the money for the party from the children’s library.

108
00:03:36.554 --> 00:03:39.729
 What?! That makes me very angry.

What can I do, Ms. Weaver?

116
00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.790
 Take out my feelings and put them here …

117
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.177
