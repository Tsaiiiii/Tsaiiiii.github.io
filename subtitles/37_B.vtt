00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.970
You know, I am from the country and sometimes I miss it.

2
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.352
 But I really like life in the city!

3
00:00:09.352 --> 00:00:10.947
 I love the city.

4
00:00:10.947 --> 00:00:13.762
 Oh, look. Someone lost a bag.

5
00:00:13.762 --> 00:00:15.545
 Maybe it's theirs.

6
00:00:15.545 --> 00:00:18.360
 Excuse me. Is this bag yours?

<c.yellow>No. It's not mine.</c.yellow>

11
00:00:19.103 --> 00:00:21.688
<c.yellow> It might be hers.</c.yellow>

12
00:00:21.864 --> 00:00:22.912
Thank you.

13
00:00:22.912 --> 00:00:26.056

<c.yellow> It might be his.</c.yellow>

19
00:00:29.264 --> 00:00:30.295
Thank you.

<c.yellow>Yes, that's mine.</c.yellow>

<c.yellow> These are all my travel things.</c.yellow>

26

<c.yellow> Thank you, thank you!</c.yellow>

27
00:00:39.846 --> 00:00:41.372
Are you okay?

28
00:00:41.372 --> 00:00:43.486
 You seem nervous.

<c.yellow>Well, this is my first visit to Washington, D.C.</c.yellow>

33
00:00:45.892 --> 00:00:49.437
<c.yellow> I'm from a small town in the country.</c.yellow>

34
00:00:48.436 --> 00:00:50.910
<c.yellow> I feel a little lost.</c.yellow>

35
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.247
I am from the country too! And I understand.

36
00:00:55.247 --> 00:01:00.040
 When I first came here, I felt lost all the time.

<c.yellow>So, do you like living in the country or in the city?</c.yellow>

41
00:01:04.228 --> 00:01:06.892
I like to live in the city.

<c.yellow>Why?</c.yellow>

46
00:01:07.908 --> 00:01:09.669
The city is exciting!

47
00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:12.856
 It has more culture than the country.

48
00:01:12.856 --> 00:01:15.590
 There are many museums and restaurants.

49
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.649
 Every night, there is theater and music.

50
00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.829
 And, there are more jobs.

51
00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:23.674
 That is why I'm here.

<c.yellow>Well, I agree.</c.yellow>

56
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.330
<c.yellow> There is more culture in the city and there might be more jobs.</c.yellow>

57
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.880
<c.yellow> But the country has more nature!</c.yellow>

58
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.720
<c.yellow> It's peaceful and beautiful.</c.yellow>

59
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.780
<c.yellow> There are more trees and mountains.</c.yellow>

60
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.560
<c.yellow> The air is clean.</c.yellow>

61
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.230
<c.yellow> You can go hiking and camping.</c.yellow>

62
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.000
<c.yellow> The city is not beautiful.</c.yellow>

63
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.830
<c.yellow> It's noisy and dirty.</c.yellow>

64
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.550
I disagree.

65
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.260
 I think all the different buildings are beautiful.

66
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.724
 And I like to watch all the different people.

<c.yellow>That's another thing that is different.</c.yellow>

71
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.210
<c.yellow> People in the country are friendly.</c.yellow>

72
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.690
<c.yellow> They always say hello.</c.yellow>

73
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.182
<c.yellow> Here, no one says hello.</c.yellow>

74
00:02:05.182 --> 00:02:08.204
<c.yellow> I think city people are rude.</c.yellow>

75
00:02:08.332 --> 00:02:09.335
Well, I agree.

76
00:02:09.335 --> 00:02:11.414
 Country people are friendly.

77
00:02:11.414 --> 00:02:14.281
 But I don't think city people are rude.

78
00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:16.216
 I think they're just busy.

Look at me.

84
00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:22.032
 I live in the city and I said "hello" to you.

<c.yellow>But you are from the country.</c.yellow>

89
00:02:24.552 --> 00:02:26.129
I have an idea.

90
00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.860
 Let's say "hello" to people- to many people!

95
00:02:32.584 --> 00:02:37.792
Well, if we say "hello," then they will say "hello" to other people.

96
00:02:37.792 --> 00:02:38.320

00:02:40.905 --> 00:02:43.659
<c.yellow> That's a great idea!</c.yellow>

102
00:02:42.658 --> 00:02:45.914
<c.yellow> I'm glad you found my bag.</c.yellow>

103
00:02:46.042 --> 00:02:49.526
Come on. Let's go say "hello" to people.

104
00:02:49.526 --> 00:02:52.661
 We don't have to agree with people.

105
00:02:52.661 --> 00:02:56.145
 They have their opinions. We have ours.

106
00:02:56.145 --> 00:03:01.110
 And as we like to say, you can always agree to disagree!

107
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.590
 Until next time!

108
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.200
 Hello!
