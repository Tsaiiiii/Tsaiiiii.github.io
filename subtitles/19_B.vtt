Hi there!

2
00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.903
 Summer in Washington, D.C. is hot and sunny.

3
00:00:05.903 --> 00:00:09.382
 I always ride the Metro to work.

4
00:00:09.382 --> 00:00:13.072
 Riding the Metro is cool and fast.

5
00:00:13.072 --> 00:00:15.497
 But today it’s closed.

6
00:00:15.497 --> 00:00:18.238
 So, I am walking to work.

7
00:00:18.238 --> 00:00:22.034
 Ms. Weaver, I am late this morning.

8
00:00:22.034 --> 00:00:24.248
 The Metro is closed.

9
00:00:24.248 --> 00:00:26.989
 So, I am walking to work.

<c.yellow>That’s too bad.</c.yellow>

14
00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:30.493
<c.yellow> It’s really hot today.</c.yellow>

15
00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.021
Yes it is.

00:00:35.363 --> 00:00:38.021
<c.yellow> I have important news to tell you.</c.yellow>

21
00:00:38.173 --> 00:00:40.662
Of course. Good-bye.

22
00:00:40.662 --> 00:00:43.773
 My boss has news for me.

23
00:00:43.773 --> 00:00:49.497
 The question is: Is it good news or bad news?

24
00:00:49.497 --> 00:00:51.861

<c.yellow>Anna, I have good news and I have bad news.</c.yellow>

29
00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.723
<c.yellow> Which do you want to hear first?</c.yellow>

30
00:00:58.669 --> 00:01:00.222
The good news.

31
00:01:00.222 --> 00:01:02.995
 No … okay, the bad news.

<c.yellow>The bad news is you are not good at reading the news.</c.yellow>

36
00:01:08.795 --> 00:01:12.095
Oh. I am very sorry to hear that.

Next month is July.

42
00:01:21.027 --> 00:01:23.645
 You are firing me in July.

<c.yellow>No. I am not firing you in July …</c.yellow>

47
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.112
<c.yellow> or in August or in September.</c.yellow>

48
00:01:29.112 --> 00:01:30.969
<c.yellow> That is the good news.</c.yellow>

49
00:01:31.137 --> 00:01:34.064
Okay. You are not firing me.

66
00:02:08.483 --> 00:02:10.635
<c.yellow> a children’s show.</c.yellow>

67
00:02:11.905 --> 00:02:15.186
A children’s show ...

68
00:02:15.186 --> 00:02:17.841
 That is awesome!

69
00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:20.497

I have tons of ideas!

76
00:02:27.432 --> 00:02:32.077
 I can show children what it’s like in outer space or ...

<c.yellow> Please go think of more … at your desk.</c.yellow>

87
00:02:40.643 --> 00:02:44.489
Yes. What other things can I show them?

88
00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.770
 Mt. Everest!

89
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.827
 Everyone has different skills.
