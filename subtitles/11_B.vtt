Hello! DC is a city for walking.

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.460
 In our neighborhood, I can do all my errands.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.240
 Marsha, before we get ice cream,

4
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.781
 I need to return three books to the library.

5
00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.725
 Where is the library?

<c.yellow>Anna, what are those in the books?</c.yellow>

20
00:00:34.226 --> 00:00:41.093
Marsha, these are letters to my family and friends back home … four letters!

21
00:00:41.093 --> 00:00:44.165
 Is there a post office near here?

25
00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:48.500
<c.yellow>Um, no. The post office is far from here.</c.yellow>

26
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.697
<c.yellow> But there is a mailbox across from the store.</c.yellow>

27
00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:53.300
Awesome! Let’s go!

28
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.015
