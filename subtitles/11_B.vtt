Hello! DC is a city for walking

2
00:00:03.786 --> 00:00:07.829
 In our neighborhood, I can do all my errands

3
00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:14.748
 Marsha, before we get ice cream, I need to return three books to the library

4
00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:16.725
 Where is the library?

<c.yellow>Anna, what are those in the books?</c.yellow>

21
00:00:34.226 --> 00:00:44.165
Marsha, these are letters to my family and friends back home … four letters! Is there a post office near here?

<c.yellow>Um, no</c.yellow>

26
00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:47.973
<c.yellow> The post office is far from here</c.yellow>

27
00:00:47.973 --> 00:00:51.697
<c.yellow> But there is a mailbox across from the store</c.yellow>
