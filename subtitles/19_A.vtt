<c.yellow>Hi there!</c.yellow>

2
00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:05.903
<c.yellow> Summer in Washington, D.C. is hot and sunny.</c.yellow>

3
00:00:04.902 --> 00:00:09.382
<c.yellow> I always ride the Metro to work.</c.yellow>

4
00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:13.072
<c.yellow> Riding the Metro is cool and fast.</c.yellow>

5
00:00:12.071 --> 00:00:15.497
<c.yellow> But today it’s closed.</c.yellow>

6
00:00:14.496 --> 00:00:18.580
<c.yellow> So, I am walking to work.</c.yellow>

7
00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:22.700
<c.yellow> Ms. Weaver, I am late this morning.</c.yellow>

8
00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.248
<c.yellow> The Metro is closed.</c.yellow>

9
00:00:23.248 --> 00:00:26.989
<c.yellow> So, I am walking to work.</c.yellow>

10
00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:28.462
That’s too bad.

11
00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:30.493
 It’s really hot today.

<c.yellow>Yes it is.</c.yellow>

16
00:00:32.173 --> 00:00:35.363
When you arrive, please come to my office.

17
00:00:35.363 --> 00:00:38.021

<c.yellow>Of course. Good-bye.</c.yellow>

22
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:43.773
<c.yellow> My boss has news for me.</c.yellow>

23
00:00:42.773 --> 00:00:50.230
<c.yellow> The question is: Is it good news or bad news?</c.yellow>

24
00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:51.861
<c.yellow> Hello, Ms. Weaver.</c.yellow>

25
00:00:52.013 --> 00:00:56.450
Anna, I have good news and I have bad news.

26
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.723
 Which do you want to hear first?

<c.yellow>The good news.</c.yellow>

31
00:00:59.222 --> 00:01:02.995
<c.yellow> No … okay, the bad news.</c.yellow>

32
00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:07.815
The bad news is you are not good at reading the news.

33
00:01:07.295 --> 00:01:07.795
<c.yellow>●●●</c.yellow>

34

<c.yellow>Oh. I am very sorry to hear that.</c.yellow>

37
00:01:12.995 --> 00:01:17.735
So, starting next month you will not read the news.

<c.yellow>Next month is July.</c.yellow>

42
00:01:20.027 --> 00:01:23.645
<c.yellow> You are firing me in July.</c.yellow>

43
00:01:24.025 --> 00:01:26.690
No. I am not firing you in July …

44
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.112
 or in August or in September.

45
00:01:29.112 --> 00:01:30.969
 That is the good news.

<c.yellow>Okay. You are not firing me.</c.yellow>

50
00:01:33.063 --> 00:01:36.886
<c.yellow> I am not reading the news.</c.yellow>

51
00:01:35.885 --> 00:01:39.185
<c.yellow> What will I be doing?</c.yellow>

52
00:01:39.345 --> 00:01:43.306
Well, you are good at asking questions.

53
00:01:43.306 --> 00:01:46.861
 You are good at talking to people.

54
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:50.822
 You are good at showing your feelings.

55
00:01:50.822 --> 00:01:54.275

<c.yellow> But what does all that mean?</c.yellow>

61
00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:03.839
I have a new assignment for you!

62
00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:08.483
 Your skills are perfect for a new show …

63
00:02:08.483 --> 00:02:10.635

<c.yellow> I can show children what it’s like in outer space or ...</c.yellow>

Those are great ideas, Anna.

83
00:02:37.464 --> 00:02:41.075
 Please go think of more … at your desk.
