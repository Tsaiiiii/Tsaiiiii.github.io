Hi there!

2
00:00:01.628 --> 00:00:06.166
 Washington, D.C. has many fun places to eat.

3
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:09.999
 But, sometimes it's more fun to cook.

4
00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:14.330
 In fact, tonight Marsha and I are cooking for friends.

5
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.930
 Well, she is cooking.

6
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.287
 I am doing the shopping.

7
00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:21.598
 It’s Marsha.

8
00:00:21.598 --> 00:00:22.808
 Hi, Marsha.

<c.yellow>Hi, Anna. Do you have the shopping list?</c.yellow>

13
00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:29.434
Yes, I told you: I have the shopping list.

14
00:00:29.434 --> 00:00:30.830
 Can you hear it?

15
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.000

<c.yellow>Okay, good. I hear the list.</c.yellow>

19
00:00:32.554 --> 00:00:38.114
<c.yellow> Anna, please buy all the ingredients on the list.</c.yellow>

20
00:00:38.282 --> 00:00:40.190
Yes, Marsha, I will.

24
00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.990
<c.yellow>And do not spend too much time shopping.</c.yellow>

25
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.277
No, Marsha, I won’t.

26
00:00:46.277 --> 00:00:47.737
 See you later.

27
00:00:47.737 --> 00:00:51.240
 Sometimes, Marsha worries too much.

28
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.895
 I love shopping!

29
00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:56.496
 And, I did not spend too much money.

30
00:00:56.496 --> 00:01:00.292
 Oh, no! But I did spend too much time!

31
00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:02.920
 I have to return home now!

35

<c.yellow>Anna, what took you so long?</c.yellow>

36
00:01:05.646 --> 00:01:09.116
<c.yellow> Our guests will be here soon!</c.yellow>

37
00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:10.797
Don’t worry, Marsha.

38
00:01:10.797 --> 00:01:13.320
 I bought everything on the list.

<c.yellow>Let me see.</c.yellow>

43
00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:25.942
<c.yellow> You bought a bunch of bananas, a box of pancake mix, a bag of coffee…</c.yellow>

44
00:01:24.941 --> 00:01:29.646
<c.yellow> Anna, this is all wrong!</c.yellow>

45
00:01:29.838 --> 00:01:31.360
What do you mean wrong?

46
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:42.318
 I bought a jar of peanut butter and a loaf of bread… no, wait… two loaves of bread.

<c.yellow>Anna, these are the wrong ingredients!</c.yellow>

51
00:01:46.478 --> 00:01:49.893
These ingredients are all on the list!

52
00:01:49.893 --> 00:01:53.038
 I took this list from the counter.

56

<c.yellow>Anna, this is the shopping list for breakfast.</c.yellow>

57
00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:05.006
<c.yellow> I said, take the shopping list on the refrigerator for dinner!</c.yellow>

58
00:02:05.198 --> 00:02:11.118
Marsha, there was no shopping list on the refrigerator for dinner!

<c.yellow>Oh no! It’s on the floor!!</c.yellow>

63
00:02:13.724 --> 00:02:18.024
<c.yellow> What are we going to do?</c.yellow>

64
00:02:18.192 --> 00:02:20.280
When do our guests arrive?

<c.yellow>They arrive in 30 minutes!</c.yellow>

69
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.719
I can fix this.

70
00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:27.576
 Do you trust me?

<c.yellow>Do I have to?</c.yellow>

75
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.859
Yes.
